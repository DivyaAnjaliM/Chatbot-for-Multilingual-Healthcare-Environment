episodes of brpbr on the day of admission BRBPR The patient was in the intensive care unit given his lower GI bleed An angiography showed bleeding in two vessels off of the Minnie supplying the sigmoid that were succesfully embolized The patient was transfused from a Hct to on the day of discharge His coumadin was held during his stay given his acute bleed but restarted per his PCP with the guidance of GI on the day of discharge The patient underwent a flex sigmoidoscopy on Friday which showed old blood in the rectal vault but no active source of bleeding Given this it was advised that the patient have a colonoscopy to rule out further bleeding The patient had a colonoscopy on Monday but unfortunately was unable to complete the study as his bowel prep was inadequate Therefore he had a repeat colonoscopy on which showed expected mucosal signs of moderate ulcerative colitis no polyps w mm ulcer at junction of distal descending colon and sigmoid colon Biopsies were obtained during his colonoscopy and he should follow up with gastroenterology for the results Ulcerative colitis The patient s Asacol was originally held but restarted the day prior to discharge per GI CADCHF The patient was restarted on his home regimen prior to discharge as it was held temporarily given his acute GI bleed The exception is that per his PCP Jason aspirin will be held for weeks given that he was restarted on coumadin with his risk of bleeding DM The patient was maintained on his home insulin regimen ho DVTPE Coumadin was initially held It was unclear at first as to why the patient required lifelong anticoagulation After discussing this with his PCP Leon was clear that the patient had had recurrent DVTs and ultimately a PE and his PCP felt strongly that he required longterm

with adverse reaction to Fentanyl and tongue injury HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a yearold female status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography on the day of admission which had been done to evaluate for possible bile leak after cholecystectomy was performed four days ago The patient was in her usual state of health until four days prior to admission when she had a cholecystectomy Her postop course was uneventful until one day prior to admission when she developed abdominal pain She went to an outside hospital Emergency Room and was reassured and sent home On the day of admission she returned to the outside hospital Emergency Room where an abdominal CT was performed which showed thickened stomach and free air She was sent to New England Sinai Hospital Rehab Center for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and possible stent placement She had a successful endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which showed a bile leak at the duct of Luschka A stent was placed successfully After her endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography the patient developed jaw clenching biting tongue rigidity and cold chills The patient received ampicillin Gentamycin and Flagyl empirically as well as Narcan to reverse fentanyl Because of the tongue injury and tachycardia as well as possible infection given her fevers or chills the GI Service transferred the patient to the CMED CCU for close observation PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Hiatal hernia Status post cholecystectomy four days prior to admission Urinary frequency secondary to interstitial cystitis Mitral valve prolapse Tubal ligation many years ago MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION Prempro CMED CCU drops ALLERGIES No known drug allergies at the time of admission however it is assumed that her

platelets neutrophil count lymphocytes monocytes troponin was less then Sodium potassium chloride bicarb BUN creatinine glucose albumin calcium LDH AST ALT of amylase CK Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at beats per minute There was normal axis Normal intervals There were no ST or T wave changes Abdominal CT showed inflammation in the right upper quadrant small fluid in the circumferential thickening of the distal stomach There was a question of a small ulcer There was a tiny amount of free air This was per report of Vencor Hospital HOSPITAL COURSE In summary the patient is a yearold female who was admitted to Quincy Medical Center for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for possible stent placement for a bile leak secondary to cholecystectomy performed four days prior to admission She then suffered rigidity with jaw clenching and tongue biting secondary to Fentanyl administration and was transferred to the CMED CCU for close observation She did well overnight in the CMED CCU She was started on Ampicillin Gentamycin and Flagyl Her liver function tests and amylase and lipase were followed closely On the second hospital day the patient was doing much better and was stable from an airway perspective so she was transferred to the General Medical Floor Gastrointestinal As stated the patient was status post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent placement for a bile leak from the duct of Luschka The patient was continued on Ampicillin Gentamycin and Flagyl which had been started at the time of transfer to the CMED CCU She had waxing and waning fevers However her white blood cell count was never really elevated and she did not have a bandemia On the day of transfer to the General Medical Floor the patient had received clear liquids She did not tolerate this very well Her amylase and lipase on the day following the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography were elevated Amylase was with lipase being Therefore she was made NPO and given aggressive intravenous hydration On the second hospital day on the General Medical Floor the patient had marked rebound to palpation of her abdomen She was followed closely with serial abdominal examinations Her amylase and lipase were trending down however An abdominal CT was obtained which showed only mild pancreatitis There were no intraabdominal fluid collections which required any drainage On the third hospital day the patient s pain was improving and the rebound was decreasing Her enzymes continued to trend down She received clear liquids in the evening and tolerated these well On the day of discharge the patient was tolerating a BRAT diet without significant abdominal pain She had no further rebound She had no temperature spikes in greater then hours at the time of discharge Hematology The patient s hematocrit was at the time of admission It decreased to in the setting of aggressive hydration It remained stable at the time of discharge and it was on the day of discharge FEN The patient was aggressively hydrated given that she was NPO She required periodic repletion of her potassium Her bicarb began to drop and she developed an anion gap acidosis This was most likely secondary to ketoacidosis as she had no dextrose in her intravenous fluids This was added on the evening prior to discharge and on the day of discharge her anion gap acidosis had resolved CONDITION ON DISCHARGE Stable MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE Levaquin mg one po q day times seven days Protonix mg po q day Percocet one to two tablets

holding area and taken electively to the operating room She underwent a livingrelated renal transplant in the right iliac fossa The operation was somewhat technically difficult secondary to a short segment of ureter which was anastomosed over a stent to the bladder Otherwise there were difficulties and estimated blood loss was minimal She was taken postoperatively to the recovery room already making a large amount of urine Intraoperatively for immunosuppression she received thymoglobulin and SoluMedrol She was started on Prograf and CellCept in the postoperative period She was also

over the first few days and had her urine losses replaced with intravenous fluids On postoperative day three the patient had an episode of shortness of breath that was evaluated by both the Renal and surgical residents It was found that she was in acute pulmonary edema and required transfer to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit Her blood pressure at the time of this incident was in the range of Her electrocardiogram showed no specific ST changes but there was some loss of her R wave progression laterally Serial enzymes were drawn and Cardiology was consulted With blood pressure control via a nitroglycerin drip and fluid restriction the patient quickly improved and a had a relatively short stay in the Intensive Care Unit Throughout this time her creatinine continued to drop and there was no apparent deleterious effect on her transplant from this episode Her beta blocker was progressively increased and her nitroglycerin drip was weaned down Two days after this event she underwent an echocardiogram which was significant for slightly depressed left ventricular systolic function with severe posterior wall hypokinesis This was a change from her prior echocardiogram and demonstrated

The sagittal T images demonstrate several areas of high signal along the sulci bilaterally which could be secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhages There are several areas of hyperintensities at the convexity which could be intraaxial and could be related to hemorrhage within the metastatic lesions but in absence of gradient echo images this could not be further confirmed A CT would help for further assessment if indicated There is increased signal seen in both basal ganglia region as well as along the rolandic region bilaterally which is suggestive of global hypoxic injury to the brain There are several areas of brain edema identified in the left frontal and parietal lobe and both temporal lobes which are suspicious for areas of metastatic disease with surrounding edema There is no hydrocephalus or midline shift seen No herniation is identified Images through the skull base demonstrate soft tissue changes in the sphenoid sinus which could be due to retained secretions from intubation There is increased signal seen along the sulci on FLAIR images at the convexity which could be secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage A CT would help for further assessment and exclude proteinaceous material within the sulci Gadoliniumenhanced MRI would also help for further assessment pCXR am FINDINGS No prior comparisons Tip of the ETT projects roughly cm above the carina A right IJ central venous line is at the level of the mid SVC Tip of the NGT is below the edge of the image IVC filter and probable NU stent catheter on the left also noted Heart and mediastinum are unremarkable allowing for technique no sizeable pneumothorax There is a somewhat wedgeshaped opacity at the right lung base which could represent aspiration or pneumonia No other confluent infiltrates are appreciated pCXR pm Mild pulmonary edema Vague right lower lobe opacity most likely represents pulmonary edema though if opacity persistent after diuresis aspiration and pneumonia will become considerations ETT cm above the carina with NG tube advancement into the stomach EEG Abnormal portable EEG due to the slow and disorganized background and bursts of generalized slowing These findings indicate a widespread encephalopathy Medications metabolic disturbances and infection are among the most common causes Subarachnoid hemorrhage is another possible explanation There were no areas of prominent focal slowing and there were no epileptiform features Transthoracic echocardiogram The left atrium is normal in size Left ventricular wall thickness cavity size and systolic function are normal LVEF Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation There is no mitral valve prolapse The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined There is no pericardial effusion IMPRESSION Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function No pericardial effusion pCXR Mild left lower perihilar opacification has improved probably resolving edema There is more rightward mediastinal shift suggesting new atelectasis in the right lung Enlargement of the right hilus could represent adenopathy Whether to pursue this would depend upon clinical circumstances Heart size normal ET tube in standard placement Nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view No appreciable pneumothorax or pleural effusions pCXR

Serial arterial blood gases were followed after an arterial line was placed Her PCO gradually declined to the range Despite episodes of somnolence the first night which were presumably due to having spent the entire night in the Emergency Department she never became more hypercarbic and her PCO trended to by the time the arterial line was discontinued On the night of admission and thereafter she was noted to have a very stridorous sounding breathing when the patient was asleep This would disappear whenever she was awake Her case was discussed with EarNoseThroat and the Medical Intensive Care Unit attending She was given a trial of mixed heliumoxygen to decrease the stridor but had minimal effect EarNoseThroat recommended not considering this an airway problem unless she was stridorous while awake The patient was to arrange for Pulmonary and Medicine followup through her primary care physician upon discharge as she has not been seen in the Pulmonary Clinic in two years

echocardiograms which revealed persistent pericardial effusions She has been gently diuresed but has worsening ARF Her O requirement has increased despite diuresis She denies any CP cough fever abdominal pain diarrhea black or bloody stools or headache Her urine output decreased to nearly zero In the setting of her ongoing pericardial effusion she was transferred for closer observation to the CCU The CCU fellow and team declined to do pericardial drainage as the pt was hemodynamically stable without change in appearance of effusion by echo performed at bedside by cards fellow As she was felt by the CCU to be a poor candidate for right heart cath was hemodynamically stable with blood pressure s s systolic and pulse s s she was called out of the CCU and back to the cardiac floor without intervention The procedure team was called to consider doing a left thoracentesis but she was declined because it was felt that her effusions were transudative secondary to CHF and it was recommended to treat CHF The pt continued to have low urine output She was given a lasix drip IV upon callout of the ICU and additional boluses of IV lasix mg then mg IV were given with a good response however she remained net positive fluid balance Renal consultants did not feel there was an emergent need for dialysis A nitro drip was started in an effort to decrease her preload and afterload On call out from the CCU the pt was satting on L NC and through the following night her oxygen requirement increased to NRB wherein she was satting upper s low s ABG that evening was on L NC and early the next morning was on NRB A CXR was performed the evening of showing moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions stable cardiomegaly and a possible RLL infiltrate Vancomycin and Zosyn were

Robert Leigh to give her the update with regards to the pt s deteriorating clinical status It was felt that given her age multiple comorbidities that her prognosis was poor even prior to CCU admission possible pericardial drainage or repeat thoracenteses Goals of care were clarified with her Murphy Robert Sanchez Explained to Lewin that pt will likely need to be intubated as she cannot lie flat and most likely cannot undergo pericardial drainage thoracentesis or right heart cath with BiPAP which would have been the next measure after NRB and prior to intubation Explained that despite these invasive measures she still has a very poor prognosis Odell stated she had been thinking about this all night of and agreed that this is not what the pt would have wanted Odell does not believe the pt would want to be intubated with central line right heart cath in the CCU She requested the patient be made Comfort Measures Only She was DNRDNI on admission This was documented in the computer confirmed with Cardiology attending and fellow and conveyed to the CCU staff who were informed she may need to go for transfer which was subsequently cancelled The pt will be made comfortable with goals of care shifted towards suppressing her air hunger and pain SOB Most consistent with CHF by exam although unknown what the severity of her COPD is currently TTE revealed large pericardial

raised question of RV perforation from pacer however she had a normal echo appearance of lead no tamponade by exam This has still be known to occur during the placement of pacemaker It was felt posthumously that her large pericardial effusion was most likely secondary to a complication of pacer placement although this was not seen on imaging In the last hours of her life her pulsus was and she was felt to likely to have aspect of tamponade physiology since her preload was reduced CHF normal EF on TTE so possibly with diastolic dysfunction ruled out for MI See course of diuresis above We

back to the CMED CCU on for further monitoring Patient s hypoxia was felt most likely to be caused by pneumonia She was started on appropriate antibiotics Etiology of patient s tachypnea was unclear

seizure activity MRI was suboptimal due to motion artifact and LP was unremarkable Despite absence of seizure activity on EEG patient was continued on Dilantin Her delirium was felt possibly secondary to withdrawal versus toxic metabolic but gradually improved slowly and therefore patient did not receive treatment for barbiturate withdrawal Her mental status tachypnea and hypoxia all improved and patient was subsequently transferred back to the floor medical team on While on the floor the patient s mental status was noted to be improved back at baseline compared to that back to the CMED CCU

patient d pm BP meds were held and she was administered L NS over the course of the day with subsequent SBP s in the high s low s The hypotension was likely due to volume depletion caused by her diarrhea loose stools in addition to decreased PO intake secondary to her GERD and thrush All of this occurred in the setting of aggressive BP management with metoprolol BID HCTZ Triampterene as a replacment for lasix due to recurrent hypokalemia Benicar mg QD and Imdur mg QD Infection sepsis was not likely given she was afebrile and had no localizing sx with an improving lung exam and requirement Given the patient s recent RP bleed there was concern for a recurrent bleed Her groin exam was unchanged Her Hct dropped from Hct before fluids to sp L NS and was thought to be dilutional Repeat hcts were stable The patient was kept an additional two days to follow her hcts and titrate her BP meds As volume depletion was thought to be the cause of her low BP only the BBlocker was restarted She was also placed on on low dose spironolactone as a K sparing diuretic and for BP control in addition to Toprol XL mg QD for her coronary disease She tolerated these meds with SBP s in the high s to s and was therefore discharged on this regimen She will need follow up with her PCP within B week after discharge from the extended care facility for further BP titration and monitoring of her electrolytes Thrush This is likely secondary to her steroid inhalers and PO prednisone for COPD exacerbation She was started on nystatin swish and swallow QID The patient was encouraged to take

Admission Date Discharge Date Date of Birth Sex M Service NOTE The Discharge Date of is pending HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Briefly this year old male with a history of coronary artery disease diabetes mellitus peripheral vascular disease was admitted originally to the Podiatry Service for a left patellar midfoot ulcer He underwent angiogram on to evaluate his circulation and found at that time that the patient had a poor circulation to the left leg The patient was transferred to the Vascular Surgery Service for bilateral iliac stenting at that time The patient also at that time was followed by Cardiology and for preoperative evaluation had a stress test which was positive and he became diaphoretic but denied any chest pain Atropine was given and heart rate returned to the s and his blood pressure returned to the s over s The patient denied any orthopnea shortness of breath chest pain paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or cough He had occasional leg swelling PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in and and status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty times two Diabetes mellitus type since age now currently on insulin which is

without bruits His lungs were clear His heart was regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops His abdomen was soft nontender nondistended Bowel sounds are present He had bilateral femoral bruits and he had one plus popliteal pulses His pedal pulses are absent LABORATORY On admission his BUN was creatinine hematocrit and the cholesterol was HOSPITAL COURSE The patient is admitted to this hospital through the Podiatry Service however the stress test showed multivessel disease Podiatry continued to follow for evaluation of his left foot ulcer At the time of discharge he was having acetic acid wettodry dressing changes q day Vascular Surgery was following at the same time and decided that bilateral iliac stenting would be the most optimum treatment currently and suggested that the patient should be worked up for cardiac disease prior to revascularization Medicine was also consulted at that time for high blood pressure and for the biceps pain While having angiography he had a transient increase in his blood pressure and became diaphoretic and thus precipitated the evaluation for cardiac disease Cardiology was consulted at that time to evaluate his heart The patient was managed on the Medical Service for his drop in blood pressure and cardiac evaluation He was also followed by Podiatry and Vascular Surgery He was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory which showed multivessel disease and Cardiothoracic Surgery was consulted The patient was taken to the Operating Room on where a coronary artery bypass graft times four was performed left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending saphenous vein graft to diagonal saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein graft to PC by Dr Wright The patient was transferred to the CSRU postoperatively where he did well He was slowly weaned from his ventilator and was able to be extubated The patient was able to be weaned to six liters nasal cannula after extubation however it was noted on chest xray that he had a small apical pneumothorax A repeat chest xray showed resolution of that pneumothorax The patient was continued on an insulin drip for his diabetes mellitus but continued to improve His chest tube was in place for a high chest tube output His Foley catheter was removed and the patient was transferred to the Floor Physical Therapy was consulted in order to assess the patient s ambulation and mobility however with his foot infection and associated pain it was difficult to assess at that time After arriving on the Floor the patient had an episode of rapid atrial fibrillation which was treated with amiodarone and Lopressor The patient resolved however Lasix was also given due to some pulmonary edema and increasing oxygen need The patient continued to have episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation while on the Floor which required continued diuresis as well as intravenous Lopressor His chest tube and Foley catheter were removed on postoperative day number three and the patient had aggressive chest Physical Therapy and nebulizer treatments His dressing changes for his foot continued per the Podiatry Service and his leg ulcer was noted to be slowly healing The patient had multiple episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation which again required intravenous Lopressor Amiodarone boluses were given and the patient was started on three times a day of po amiodarone aggressive pulmonary toilet and continued diuresis was done however the patient continued to have respiratory difficulties when in rapid atrial fibrillation The patient was evaluated on postoperative day number five and it was decided at that time that the patient should be transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory difficulties He was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where he was aggressively diuresed as well as his rate was controlled and chest Physical Therapy and nebulizer treatments were done The patient improved slowly Also his white blood cell count was found to rise to this was most likely due to a secondary infection of his foot and Zosyn was started The patient continued to do well and his recurrent atrial fibrillation slowly improved po doses of Lopressor slowly increased to get better control of his rate and the patient was able to be controlled with a heart rate in the s to s with Lopressor Following initiation of his Zosyn the white count continued to improve and the patient was planned for a PICC line for longterm intravenous antibiotics The patient was started on Lopressor mg po twice a day with good control with a heart rate of s to s He is in sinus rhythm He was also started on his preoperative medications of Amlodipine and Losartan with improvement of his blood pressure The patient was also reduced to mg q day of amiodarone Pulmonary was consulted at this time for this difficulty of diuresis and pulmonary edema They continued to agree with the management of the patient and with aggressive pulmonary toilet as well as diuresis and nebulizer treatment The patient was transferred back from the Intensive Care Unit on and upon arriving on the floor he continued to do well Pulmonary toilet and aggressive chest Physical Therapy was continued and the patient was able to be weaned from his oxygen Furthermore his Foley catheter was removed and he was started on anticoagulation for his episodes of atrial fibrillation He had been started on heparin in the Intensive Care Unit and that was continued Coumadin was then begun with a goal INR of to At that time he was stabilized from a cardiac perspective Podiatry and Vascular Surgery were reconsulted to assess the patient s needs for revascularization and for his foot ulcer It was decided at that time that the patient could be discharged in followup with Vascular Surgery for revascularization and Podiatry thereafter On the patient had a PICC line placed for a six week course of intravenous Zosyn for his foot ulcer and his Coumadin was also continued The patient did well and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility at that time His discharge date is pending CURRENT DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS Regular

unrestrained driver and struck a telephone pole He was ejected from the car and landed on his face Extreme damage was reported to the vehicle by first responders It was presumed highspeed motor vehicle collision The patient was CMEDflighted to Quincy Medical Center and he was intubated upon arrival in the Emergency Department After initial trauma assessment and initiation of resuscitation a CT scan was performed Images of his head abdomen and thorax were obtained His injuries included bilateral zygomal and orbital rim fractures a right temporal fracture bilateral frontal contusions and a right temporal epidural versus subdural hematoma The anterior and posterior of the frontal sinus was fractured with communication with the ethmoid air cells presumably caused air in the orbit PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Denies PAST SURGICAL HISTORY Denies SOCIAL HISTORY Denies ALLERGIES Denies MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION Denies PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION Initial examination revealed the patient had a heart rate in the s with a blood pressure of s He was intubated with multiple abrasions and severe swelling and contusions of his face He was not following commands His Boston Coma Scale was His pupils were reactive on the right going from mm to mm of light The response was brisk On the left his pupils went from mm to mm also brisk Initial evaluation revealed corticate posturing was noted by the trauma team He withdrew equally and purposefully after minutes in the trauma bay He withdrew to noxious stimuli equally and purposefully after minutes in the trauma bay HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM NEUROLOGY Mr Roach was transported to Intensive Care Unit from the trauma bay Upon arrival Neurosurgery promptly placed V Holtzen bolt This allowed continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure Notably intracranial pressure was when the bolt was placed During his hospitalization his intracranial pressure was monitored very closely and maintained to a level of less than To do this mannitol mg q h was used While using mannitol his serum osmolalities were followed closely In addition to monitoring his intracranial pressure his systemic blood pressures were maintained in such a manner that his cerebral perfusion pressure was maintained at mmHg A parameter monitor for his neurologic status PaCO which was maintained between and during his hospitalization Mr Roach was kept sedated with propofol and was given Fentanyl and or morphine boluses for pain Neurologic checks were followed initially every one hour and then every two hours to monitor for change in neurologic examination During his hospitalization two subsequent CAT scans were obtained one on hospital day two This CAT scan revealed possible worsening and was read as epidural versus subdural bleed After a discussion with both Radiology and Neurosurgery the decision was made that the worsening did not appear significant and this was not accompanied by a change in his clinical condition His intracranial pressure remained stable and his clinical examination was unchanged An additional CT scan was obtained on hospital day three This examination was unchanged from the previous examination Again his intracranial pressure and neurologic examination remained the same and conservative treatment was opted for CARDIOVASCULAR As described in previous section NeoSynephrine and eventually Levophed were used to maintain a coronary perfusion pressure of greater than A pulmonary artery catheter was placed on hospital day four This catheter was placed when the patient started to demonstrate septic physiology and for increasing pressor support Please see Infectious Disease section for more details GASTROINTESTINAL Mr Roach was npo from the time of his admission A orogastric tube was passed Initially during admission carafate was given down the orogastric tube However on a routine chest xray shot on hospital day three a mediastinum was noted This raised the question of potential esophageal rupture Gastroenterology was consulted for this Gastroenterology was consulted to assist in creating the most appropriate diagnostic rhythm given his intubated and sedated status At this point his carafate was switched to intravenous Protonix and he was strictly npo HEMATOLOGY Throughout Mr Richard admission his hematocrit remained stable in the low s As will be discussed in the Infectious Disease section he developed an episode of what appeared to be sepsis and his white blood cell count peaked at Mr Roach was on Pneumo boots spontaneous compression devices for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis He was not a candidate for subcutaneous heparin as we were concerned of an intracranial hemorrhage An inferior vena cava filter was considered but was deferred as it was felt that Mr Roach was too unstable to undergo the procedure ENDOCRINE Mr Marian blood sugar was maintained under tight control from to using a regular insulin slidingscale INFECTIOUS DISEASE Mr Roach had a spike in white blood cell count and developed fevers His blood urine and sputum were all cultured Blood cultures were pertinent for one bottle of gram positive coagulase negative Staphylococcus which grew from His preliminary cultures including sputum from grew Escherichia coli Sputum from grew gramnegative rods not yet speciated and from a bronchoalveolar lavage grew gramnegative rods and polymorphonuclear lymphocytes Throughout this time Mr Richard temperature continued to increase and was such that on hospital day four his temperature maximum was degrees centigrade During his hospitalization his was treated with vancomycin for his gramnegative rods imipenem and Flagyl Initially he had been placed on clindamycin to cover his drain but his cultures became positive and his white blood cell count increased He was switched from clindamycin to the imipenem and Flagyl Vancomycin was added when we had the positive blood culture With a fever of up to degrees centigrade aggressive measures including cooling blankets alcohol swabs and fans were used in an attempt to bring his body temperature down Hypercarbia would result and increase in cerebral perfusion paralysis was initiated to decrease genesis of carbon dioxide secreted during shivering PULMONARY As discussed in the Infectious Disease section Mr Roach developed a pneumonia likely from gramnegative organisms but most likely from Escherichia coli For this pneumonia he was placed empirically on imipenem vancomycin and Flagyl On hospital day three Mr Roach had developed an episode of tachycardia and tachypnea For this a CT angiogram was obtained which demonstrated no pulmonary embolism On hospital day four a routine chest xray revealed a leftsided pneumothorax For this a left Caucasian chest tube was placed On the evening of hospital day four Mr Roach had an acute episode whereby his central venous pressure rose sharply and immediately followed by a period of asystole Urgent resuscitation measures were initiated The measures included attempts at pacing Epinephrine and atropine were administered as were bicarbonate and calcium He had a differential diagnosis of asystole preceded by an acute rise in central venous pressure included attention pneumothorax cardiac tamponade and pulmonary embolism During the resuscitation afterwards it was noted that a patent left chest tube was present in the left chest so initially neodecompression was attempted in the right chest There was no sign of attention pneumothorax with decompression and a right chest tube was placed During this time a needle aspiration of what was felt to be the pericardium was performed revealing bloody fluid coming back A left anterior thoracotomy was made by the Cardiac Surgery fellow who was present After minutes of active resuscitation including internal cardiac massage there was no evidence of return of vital signs or electric activity to the heart as noted on electrocardiogram monitors Resuscitation was terminated at on After the termination of resuscitation both the anesthesia Intensive Care Unit attending and the surgical attending were present to discuss the proceedings events with the patient s

Admission Date Discharge Date Date of Birth Sex M Service CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS This is a yearold gentleman who was admitted to the St Anne s Hospital as a transfer from the Kindred Park View Specialty Hospital of Springfield Prior to admission he had a long and complicated hospital course at the outside hospital His hospital course began on when he underwent a right carotid endarterectomy for stenosis of the carotid artery His postoperative course was complicated by nonspecific T wave changes consistent with myocardial infarction postoperatively as well as hematoma formation The hematoma formation was rapidly expanding and he received an emergent surgical airway in the Intensive Care Unit This emergent cricothyroidotomy was converted then to a formal tracheostomy During his subsequent hospital course he had an additional CHF exacerbation He was medically managed and eventually his tracheostomy was decannulated However just prior to admission to Mass Eye Ear Infirmary he had another acute decompensation with CHF exacerbation This necessitated emergent intubation With EKG changes consistent with myocardial infarction he was transferred to the Mass Eye Ear Infirmary for further management PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Diabetes type treated with oral medication Cerebrovascular disease status post left carotid endarterectomy in Status post right cerebrovascular accident in with residual leftsided weakness Status post right carotid endarterectomy on Fall from standing on with resultant displaced radial fracture which was reduced closed and

pressure He was breathing per minute and saturating His CVP is ranging from He was intubated and has a nasogastric tube His neck has a wellhealed right carotid endarterectomy scar There is also a wellhealing tracheostomy scar The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally The heart was regular with an S and S The abdomen was soft nontender nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds The extremities were without edema The left arm was in a cast HOSPITAL COURSE Mr Knueppel was admitted to the CCU at the Mass Eye Ear Infirmary Upon admission he was treated for his pneumonia He was medically managed for CHF and underwent a cardiac catheterization on His catheterization revealed stenosis of the distal left main coronary artery stenosis of the LAD stenosis of the circumflex stenosis of OM and a proximally occluded right coronary artery After reviewing cardiac catheterization data a consultation was made with Cardiothoracic Surgery who deemed that he was a good candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting Over the ensuing days Mr Nina CHF was managed by the CCU Team and he received treatment for what was now determined to be a Klebsiella pneumonia He was treated with a full course of Zosyn On Mr Knueppel went to the Operating Room with Dr Streeter He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft of four vessels He had a saphenous vein graft to his LAD and diagonal in a sequential fashion saphenous vein graft to his PDA and a saphenous vein graft to his OM The procedure was performed by Dr Streeter and assisted by Dr The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication and was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit without complication Please see the previously dictated operative note for more details Mr Knueppel had a long postoperative course His postoperative course was complicated by hypertension which was managed medically During his postoperative course he did not suffer from any arrhythmias nor did he have any episode of hypotension At the time of discharge he was on a stable antihypertensive regimen appropriate for someone with a decreased ejection fraction Mr Knueppel had had a long protracted period of intubation prior to the operation The status of Mr Nina pulmonary system necessitated a prolonged postoperative intubation After a very slow wean from ventilatory support Mr Knueppel was successfully extubated on postoperative day number nine He continued to be very tenuous from a pulmonary point of view and required frequent chest PT For this reason Mr Knueppel was kept in the Intensive Care Unit where very close monitoring could be performed In addition he had chest PT performed at very regular intervals by the ICU staff His pulmonary status was so tenuous that we were unable to transfer him to the regular patient care floor during his hospitalization Mr Knueppel had an emergent cricothyroidotomy followed by a formal tracheostomy at the outside hospital There is much scarring surrounding his larynx Such a situation frequently makes it very difficult to swallow without aspirating As is expected Mr Knueppel failed a swallowing study early on in his Boston Regional Medical Centerr hospital course The study was repeated and yet again Mr Knueppel was unable to swallow without evidence of aspiration After a prolonged period of being fed via nasogastric tube Mr Knueppel finally had a formal percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placed in the Intensive Care Unit This was performed on postoperative day number This procedure was performed by Dr Kevin Taussig and assisted by Dr Carla Solan The procedure was performed under endoscopic guidance in the Intensive Care Unit without complication Please see the previously dictated operative note for more details Mr Knueppel Robertson a distal radius fracture prior to arriving to the hospital This injury had been reduced and casted at the outside institution Postoperatively there was much edema associated in the postoperative course from coronary artery bypass grafting His cast was removed by the Orthopedic Service in anticipation of this edema and to avoid compartment syndrome The cast was replaced by a plaster splint Mr Knueppel should followup with his orthopedic surgeon in the Worcester State Hospital for reassessment of his injury and possible removal of the splint By postoperative day number Mr Nina pulmonary status was deemed sufficiently stable His hypertension was well controlled and he was tolerating tube feeds At this point he was ready to be discharged to rehabilitation DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS Coronary

She was maintained on a ventilator and ventilated according to ARDSNet protocol For antibiotic coverage of her pneumonia she was started on Levaquin ceftriaxone and vancomycin Over the next two days after admission the patient s vent settings were gradually weaned and she was extubated two days after being transferred to this hospital After extubation the patient was oxygenating well on face mask She did continue to have a persistent fairly severe cough however her cough was weak due to abdominal muscle pain from repeated coughing The cough was mostly nonproductive The patient was breathing comfortably As there was no identified bacterial pathogen on any cultures the patient was continued on the triple antibiotics for first several days of the hospitalization She was also on roundtheclock Atrovent and albuterol nebulizers Once the patient was transferred out of the ICU and after extubation the antibiotics were gradually narrowed The vancomycin and Levaquin were discontinued after approximately four days in the hospital The ceftriaxone was discontinued after four days in the hospital and the patient was to continue on Levaquin The patient had gradual

recently admitted to McLean Hospital from through with a diagnosis of right heel diabetic ulcer with MSSA osteomyelitis of the calcaneus MSSA bacteremia acute interstitial nephritis secondary to oxacillin and RLL pna He was sent home with a PICC line and IV antibiotics He returned to the Wing Memorial Medical Center intubated from an outside hospital on for respiratory failure and was sent to CMED CSRU Prior to his readmission his sister had noted that he was having some shaking chills and heavy breathing When he came back to Faulkner Hospital Hospital for confusion and diaphoresis his initial oxygen sat was only with a fingerstick of He was given D but continued to have progressive respiratory failure was therefore intubated and transferred to the Austen Riggs Center where he was noted to have multifocal pneumonia and bacteremia with enterobacter and MSSA Past Medical History diabetes type since age after pancreatic trauma diabetic retinopathy direct neuropathy PVD status post

felt to be likely worsening PNA Pt remained intubated until He had difficulty weaning from the vent due to difficulties with neurological status he remained drowsy and unresponsive for many days but eventually awoke enough and was extubated without difficulty and remained stable on L NC He was transferred to the floor but a few days later began to show signs of respiratory distress and was transferred back to the CMED CSRU for reintubation for likely aspiration event leading to worsening pneumonia as well as some component of pulm edema He was extubated a few days later and transferred back to the floor where his pulm status improved dramatically with lasix and continued nebulizer treatments The patient was prepared for discharge on when he was sat ing in the high s on room air However on at am the pt was found with labored respirations rr and SaO which improved to only SaO on NRB ABG was performed mg lasix was given and the patietn had foley placed and had good urine output and good mentation He was also given nebulizers without improvement His chest radiograph had fluffy bilateral infiltrates Although the pt was wo fever he had chills He was readmitted tot he CMED CSRU for respiratory distress likely secondary to a recurrent aspiration event He was continued on meropenem started on BiPAP and aggressively suctioned in an attempt to avoid intubation On at am the patient had an acutechange in mental status with bradycardia hypertension pinpoint pupils decerebrate posturing and increased tone in bilateral upper extremities and unresponsiveness The patient was brought to CT immediately for stat scan and was found to have a massive occipital spontaneous hemorrhage into the L ventricle requiring ventricular drainage Neurosurgery was immediately called for an EVD and anesthesia was called STAT to the bedside for intubation at am in order to assist in hyperventilation After endotracheal intubation MAPs were maintained between and dilantin was dose to maintain an appropriate level L frontal ICP bolt was placed by neurosurgery under sterile conditions on antibiotics Mannitol mg iv x then gm iv tid was begun to maintain serum osm and Na The patient was hyperventilated to goal PCO with ICP improvement Serial head CT studies and neurologic exams were performed but the patient was unchaged unresponsive with posturing and no spontaneous movement despite ICP being maintained in good range On a family meeting resulted in the patient s code being changed to comfort measures only The patient was terminally extubated on a morphine drip and ativan titrated for agonal breathing and discomfort scopolamine was used as an adjunct to control secretions and appeared comfortable when he died at pm on The family refused autopsy or postmortem examination to deduce secondary causes of death ID Bacteremia and PNA Pt s triple lumen catheter was found to be growing coag neg staph and PICC tip and sputum growing enterobacter cloacae The PICC was dc ed and pt was continued on vancomycin for course of weeks and meropenem was added on for week course TEE was negative Pt finished the week course of meropenem while in house and was discharged to rehab on day of the vancomycin AIN Pt received oxacillin during his prior hospitalization and had AIN from this medication On this admission he was continued on prednisone taper Fluoroquinolones and other renal toxins were avoided Renal function gradually improved and Cr trended down from peak of to Before the patient acutely decompensated as above the plan was for steroid taper mg x days already completed mg x d already completed mg x d now day mg x d mg x d Foot ulcer The pt was followed by podiatry and had several further debridement of his R heel wound on abx podiatry following changed vac q days Encephalopathy It was unclear why the pt s mental status initially did not improve more quickly after all sedatives were removed and he was extubated His MS waxed and waned for many days and uremia vs failure to clear sedatives were considered although pt was making urine and LFT s are wnl The pt had an EEG and head CT s which did not show anoxic brain injury or bleeding He gradually improved and was AOx and near baseline before Amesbury Hospital transferred to the CMED CSRU in respiratory distress DM Pt was maintained on SSI with small amount of standing insulin while he was NPO and then his dose was gradually increased as he received tube feeds FEN The pt had an NG tube placed and received tube feeds for the majority of his hospitalization Upon extubation and transfer to the floor he pulled out the NG tube time several times and required restraints Albumin was very low and pt had significant edema likely this A few days before decompensating his mental status improved to the degree that he was able to eat normal food without aspirating CV Pump HTN pt had episodes of both hypertension and hypotension during his stay He was managed with Metoprolol Hydralazine and Amlodipine Near discharge his BP was controlled with Metoprolol only Hypernatremia While in the CMED CSRU the pt developed hypernatremia This was felt to be likely intravascular volume depletion since the pt s albumin was so low and he was third spacing all of his fluid He was volume resuscitated and managed with DW and lasix as well as receving FW boluses with his NG tube feeds The hypernatremia fully resolved when he resumed eating on his own and had access to free water Anemia Pt s Hct trended down slowly throughout his hospitalization Labs were consistent with anemia of chronic disease He was transfused units pRBC s near the end of his hospitalization and had an appropriate bump CMED CCU When the pt s MS improved to near baseline before again decompensating he became

cardiomyopathy with a transthoracic echocardiogram in showing an ejection fraction of posterior and inferior apical akinesis and large left ventricular thrombus The patient was admitted from to at which time she was ruled out for a myocardial infarction She had a cardiac catheterization which revealed vessel disease with normal left main mid left anterior descending artery diffuse mid distal stenosis at the origin of the diagonal serial and left circumflex lesions and first obtuse marginal and mid right coronary artery During initial evaluation for a coronary artery bypass graft to of the right coronary artery stenosis was found for which she underwent a right internal carotid artery stent She was discharged on Coumadin for a goal INR of to She was then admitted again on for an elective coronary artery bypass graft At surgery the descending aorta was noted to be calcified and an intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed an irregular intraaortic pedunculated lesion Given the elevated stroke risk of aortic crossclamping in the setting of this finding the plan for a bypass graft was aborted The patient was then transferred to the Coronary Care Unit Service for medical management in anticipation of possible percutaneous coronary intervention later in the admission PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Diabetes mellitus Hypertension Hypercholesterolemia Asthma Chronic low

Western Mass Hospital medical optimization and management following an aborted coronary artery bypass graft when a mobile aortic atheroma was noted The patient was continued on aspirin Plavix and statin Once the patient was titrated off dopamine the beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were restarted With regard to the left ventricular thrombus her goal INR remained to and the goal was to start heparin once the patient was stable from a thoracotomy and chest tube standpoint The patient remained comfortable By on postoperative day two the patient was doing well and the chest tube was discontinued The patient still had transcutaneous pacing wires in place Likewise on the patient was weaned off surgery without difficulty Thus the beta blocker and ACE inhibitor were started to be titrated up In addition the patient was started on Wellbutrin for smoking cessation At this point it was determined that the patient would not receive percutaneous coronary intervention on this admission and would likely be discharged to the floor for stabilization with followup The patient did well and was transferred to the floor on After evaluation and a discussion with Dr Gunter it was determined that the patient no longer needed anticoagulation since there was no aortic thrombus but only an aortic plaque and there was no anteriorapical akinesis noted At this point the left ventricular thrombus for which she was initially started therapy for was no longer present The patient was noted to have a slight hematocrit drop and was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells

about six months prior to the current admission and was started on Warfarin One month prior to this admission the patient reports not feeling well with worsening gastric distress A few weeks prior to admission he fell down on his back and started taking ibuprofen mg once a day for pain and Vioxx in addition to his aspirin and Coumadin regimen The night prior to admission he was found by his wife on the bathroom floor in a pool of urine unresponsive without any body movements postictal state EMS was activated however the patient refused to go to the hospital A similar episode happened at am the same night and at on the day of admission the patient lost consciousness once again when he was trying to sit up He was then transferred to The Hospital for Orthopedics The patient reports some nausea and epigastric pressure which is postprandial He denies any emesis melena diarrhea or constipation He describes the room spinning with attempts to sit upright No history of previous episodes was noted Denies incontinence He does have diaphoresis and weakness with orthostatic changes In the Emergency Department stool guaiac was trace positive Hematocrit was with a baseline of Gastric lavage was grossly positive for coffee ground material His INR was found to be He was given Vitamin K mg subcutaneously liters of normal saline two units of packed red blood cells and two units of fresh frozen plasma and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Hyperthyroid disease status post radioactive iodine ablation now hypothyroid on

the head showed no hemorrhage or edema EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at with normal intervals and ST wave inversions and early R wave progression HOSPITAL COURSE The patient was transferred to Medical Intensive Care Unit for further management for acute GI bleed Gastrointestinal bleed The patient continued to receive blood transfusions on the floor and serial hematocrits with serial INR checks were drawn As he was receiving his third unit of packed red blood cells the patient became tachycardic and short of breath His temperature raised from F to F He was shown to have rigors The transfusion was stopped and the patient was given Tylenol mg with epinephrine mg of hydrocortisone mg of Benadryl and Demerol as well as Pepcid He had emesis times three of cc of coffee ground material The patient also desaturated to the low s and was started on a nonrebreather mask His saturations improved quickly on nonrebreather mask within to minutes Shortly after his mental status changed he became disoriented and euphoric and continued to be in this state for two more hours After that period of time his mental status gradually improved and he continued to receive his blood transfusions requiring a total of ten units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma to reach a hematocrit of which remained stable for the duration of his stay On admission the patient was started on high dose proton pump inhibitors for prophylaxis On Wednesday an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and was significant for the following findings Medium hiatal hernia Barretts esophagus erosion of the gastroesophageal junction granularity erythema and congestion of the antrum in the prepyloric region compatible with gastritis Erosions in the antrum and prepyloric region granularity erythema and congestion of the anterior bulb and posterior bulb compatible with duodenitis It was recommended by Gastroenterology that the patient is to stay off aspirin for at least four to six weeks at discharge to prevent further bleeding Cardiovascular During transfusion reaction episode the patient had an episode of tachycardia ranging from to for one to two hours EKG during this episode was taken and showed sinus tachycardia however serial enzymes were significant for CK peaking at MB peaking at and MB index peaking at consistent with myocardial damage The day following this episode EKG showed loss of R wave progression in anterior leads and Q waves in leads III and AVF consistent with anteroseptal myocardial infarction The patient s blood pressures remained stable during his stay He had no episodes of arrhythmia on Telemetry Cardiology consultation was obtained The myocardial infarction was attributed to demand ischemia secondary to acute hematocrit drop exacerbated by tachycardia secondary to blood transfusion reaction Further Cardiologic workup was suggested as an outpatient at four to six weeks post discharge The patient was started on Lopressor Lipitor and Lisinopril After ten units of packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma transfusions the patient s hematocrit remained stable at above His INR decreased to at the time of discharge He required no blood transfusions for four days prior to discharge History of pulmonary embolism likely secondary to frequent flying The need for further anticoagulation was discussed with the patient s attending Dr Coleman and it was decided not to continue anticoagulation due to increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding The patient remained symptom free during his stay in the hospital saturating well in room air Endocrine The patient was restarted on Levothyroxine soon after admission His hemoglobin AC was sent and it was pending at the time of discharge Single mental status change times two hours during episode of blood transfusion reaction Was most likely due to multiple drugs administered during the episode including Demerol After this episode the patient

Extremities had no edema distal pedis Neurologically grossly nonfocal LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION At the time of admission white blood cell count hematocrit platelets Sodium potassium chloride bicarbonate BUN creatinine glucose Creatine kinase MB troponin of less than RADIOLOGY IMAGING Electrocardiogram revealed left atrial hypertrophy right ventricular hypertrophy and poor R wave progression which were new Also T wave inversions in II III aVF V through V new evolving right bundlebranch block HOSPITAL COURSE The patient is a yearold female with no known history of cardiac disease presenting with dyspnea on exertion and chest tightness who was admitted for evaluation and management of her symptoms CARDIOVASCULAR The patient was admitted for complaints of dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure which could be consistent with angina However given the long duration of the symptoms and negative workup in the past it was thought to be unlikely However the patient was started on an aspirin as well as a beta blocker and a rule out myocardial infarction protocol was initiated A stress thallium was planned for the day following admission However on the night of admission the patient was found lying in her bed diaphoretic and obtunded and a code was called Further examination revealed a strong palpable pulse with a systolic blood pressure in the s and a heart rate in the s Over the course of the next few minutes the patient became increasingly more responsive She was treated with a fluid bolus The patient quickly responded to a fluid bolus and became interactive She reported that she was sitting on the commode urinating and began to feel nauseous and presyncopal She was able to get to bed at which point she passed out She denied any chest pain or pressure and no shortness of breath during this event A rhythm check obtained during the time of this event demonstrated a pause of six seconds followed by a junctional escape rhythm An electrocardiogram obtained after the code demonstrated no acute changes Her acute bradycardic event was felt likely secondary to her new beta blocker in conjunction with a vagal response It was determined to stop the beta blocker and atropine was placed at the bedside On the following day the patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated dilated right ventricle secondary to chronic dysfunction and a pulmonary artery pressure of greater than Her stress test was cancelled A CT angiogram was ordered to evaluate for chronic thromboembolic disease as a potential cause of her pulmonary hypertension She was ruled out for myocardial infarction with three sets of normal enzymes and continued to be monitored on telemetry A Pulmonary consultation was obtained to evaluate for possible etiology of the patient s hypotension There was little evidence to suggest any cardiac disease and given the patient s Graves disease an autoimmune process was felt to be possible In addition consideration was given to sarcoidosis human immunodeficiency virus and druginduced given her history of herbal medication use It was recommended that the patient begin anticoagulation given the severity of her pulmonary hypertension It was also planned to undergo a right heart catheterization with a vasodilation trial by the catheterization laboratory A right heart catheterization was performed on A pharmacologic pulmonary vasodilator challenge was performed with a positive response In addition a CT angiogram of the chest with pulmonary embolism protocol showed no intravascular filling defect but did show a right upper lobe groundglass and scattered adenopathy Therefore in the end left atrial hypertension was essentially ruled out as a primary cause Chronic pulmonary embolus was less likely given her negative CT angiogram Chronic lung disease was unlikely given the patient s normal pulmonary function tests and DLCO in as well as a normal CT angiogram Collagen vascular disease could not be definitively ruled out however given the patient s lack of connective tissue disorder stigmata it was thought to be less likely and the patient s human immunodeficiency virus test was negative Therefore it was felt that the patient was most likely experiencing a primary pulmonary hypertension Consideration was given to treating the patient with a course of calcium channel blocker however given the patient s poor response to Lopressor it was determined that this would not be optimal treatment for the patient s pulmonary hypertension Therefore her insurance company was contacted regarding the potential of Flolan as a treatment Plans were made for placement of a Hickman catheter and initiation of Flolan treatment However on the patient once again experienced an episode of unresponsiveness Upon arrival by the physician the patient was awake alert and oriented with a pulse in the s with pressure in the s and satting on room air She described this episode as an uncomfortable feeling in her chest The patient was treated with liters of intravenous fluids with a bump in her systolic blood pressure to the s Review of telemetry revealed an to beat episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia followed by an episode of bradycardia to beats per minute The etiology of these cardiovascular episodes was unclear but was felt likely secondary to the patient s tenuous cardiovascular status given the fact that she had clear pulmonary hypertension was very preload dependent and had an intact left ventricular function but with cardiac output limited due to left ventricular compression by a dilated left ventricle Given the patient s persistent hypotensive episodes and decreased urine output she was transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management prior to initiation of Flolan therapy On the Hickman catheter was placed in preparation of Flolan administration During the Mass Mental Health Center Medical Intensive Care Unit stay the patient was found to exquisitely preload dependent and responded well to aggressive fluids as needed to maintain her blood pressure with a systolic of greater than She had no further episodes of bradycardia during her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay In addition the patient s urine output improved dramatically with hydration therapy suggesting her low urine output was secondary to decreased cardiac output secondary to low preload The patient continued to be followed by the Electrophysiology Service who determined that the patient was demonstrating severe vasal sensitivity with bradycardia necessitating pacemaker placement This was to be deferred until after the patient had her Hickman in place Because the patient s pulmonary pressures responded so well to adenosine during right heart catheterization it was thought that the patient would be a good candidate for Flolan therapy Flolan was initiated on at nanograms per kilogram per minute The patient was monitored for symptoms of Flolan therapy including nausea vomiting first bite jaw claudication or hypotension Over the course of the hospital stay the patient s Flolan dose was titrated to receive maximum benefit without precipitating symptoms of Flolan overdose The patient was felt to be stable on her current Flolan dose and was therefore transferred back to the floor A high resolution CT was requested to further evaluate for possible secondary cause of her primary pulmonary hypertension however the patient refused it at this time Plans for placement of a pacemaker were initiated However on the night prior to the planned surgical date the patient suffered an episode of bleeding from her Hickman catheter site Surgery was notified and pressure was applied however it did not stop oozing A surgicel dressing was placed and prolonged pressure resulted in resolution of the bleeding In addition an extra stitch was placed in an effort to stop the bleeding Following this episode the patient felt like she was too stressed for pacemaker placement Therefore she was monitored over the next few days for any further bleeding events Over the course of the next few days the patient became more accustomed to her Flolan and Flolan teaching was continued She continued to have occasional episodes of dizziness shortness of breath and hypotension whenever the alarm sounded suggesting that the Flolan bag needed to be changed However over the course of the hospital stay these decreased both in frequency and severity On the patient went for placement of a pacemaker She had dualmode dualpacing dualsensing pacemaker placed with a lower rate at ppm and upper rate of ppm with a paced AV of msec The patient recovered well from her surgery for pacemaker placement At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating her Flolan therapy well She had received a full course of Flolan teaching and reported that she and her husband felt comfortable with the administration of the medication at home She was set up with a primary pulmonary hypertension support group and home services were arranged to help her in the initiation of Flolan therapy Following pacemaker placement the patient had no further episodes of bradycardia on telemetry and therefore she was discharged in satisfactory condition INFECTIOUS DISEASE The patient had no signs or symptoms of infection at the time of admission However she was noted to have a relatively elevated white blood cell count that remained stable over the course of her hospital stay However near the end of her hospitalization the patient began describing increased urinary frequency which persisted once her Foley catheter was removed A urinalysis was positive and urine culture grew enterococcus which was pan sensitive Therefore the patient was started on levofloxacin therapy to complete a day course Following initiation of the antibiotic the patient s white blood cell count quickly came down and she remained afebrile At the time of discharge the patient still had a mildly elevated white blood cell count but was asymptomatic with a normal temperature She will complete two more days of Levaquin therapy as an outpatient RENAL The patient s BUN and creatinine were followed over the course of her hospital stay These remained stable and within normal limits It was felt that the decreased urine output was secondary to her preload dependence and that her urine output increased significantly when she was adequately hydrated in the Medical Intensive Care Unit GASTROINTESTINAL The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease She was continued on Protonix over the course of her hospital stay and had no further gastrointestinal issues HEMATOLOGY The patient s hematocrit remained stable over the course of her hospital stay Despite bleeding from the Hickman site she did not require any transfusion therapy FLUIDS ELECTROLYTES NUTRITION The patient tolerated a regular diet throughout the course of her hospital stay Her electrolytes were checked on a daily basis and remained within normal limits being replaced as needed She was discharged to home on a regular diet ENDOCRINE The patient with a history of hypothyroidism She was continued on her regular Synthroid dose She will need a TSH and T checked as an outpatient CODE STATUS The patient is a full code FLOLAN ADMINISTRATION At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating a Flolan dose of nanograms per kilogram per minute A Physical Therapy consultation was obtained to initiate a minute walk test On room air the patient s oxygen saturation was and dropped to following a minute walk The patient was discharged to home with appropriate Flolan teaching and supplies She was to follow up with Dr Savage in the Clinic the following

Admission Date Discharge Date Date of Birth Sex F Service NEUROLOGY Allergies Lamictal Keflex Navane Inderal Depakote Attending Cindy U Kelly MD Chief Complaint transfer from OSH seizure Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure Lumbar puncture History of Present Illness Ms Swanson is a yo woman with PMH significant for seizure disorder brain injury and atypical multiple sclerosis who presents with right face twitch and right arm shaking History is obtained from her sister William from Lawrence General Hospital and from her primary neurologist Dr Brian She lives in an assisted living and was noted yesterday to have generalized tonicclonic activity beginning on the right side and lasting minutes EMS gave her valium mg pr at the facility and brought her to Barnstable County Hospital She persisted with right sided seizure activity there and was given valium mg and ativan mg as well as loaded with dilantin mg She was transferred to the Providence Behavioral Health Hospital CMED Here she was given an additional valium mg x and ativan mg x for persistent twitching in her face and right hand Since the ativan her facial twitching has apparently improved but she continues to have hand twitches She also had an EEG which showed left sided slowing on preliminary read Apparently she has a long history of seizure disorder possibly from a history of traumatic brain injury though per Dr Paula records from that hospitalization indicate she may have only had a very mild injury and has been managed on dilantin and keppra Since she has seen Dr Ollie she has had at least two episodes of status epilepticus and one generalized seizure as well as some less significant seizures which are characterized by left gaze preference and left sided tonicclonic activity Her dilantin levels had been somewhat difficult to control He tried adding lamictal but this caused a rash At the time of her last visit Dr Bradley had discussed the addition of a third Castelluccio possibly zonegran less likely topamax to the dilantin mg bid and keppra mg bid Her sister had wanted to keep the current course because she felt she was doing well where she was living and did not want to upset that However she had several dilantin levels drawn since her last visit with in in Theresa and Her sister reports that the medication dose had been changed to mg qam and mg qpm in Theresa and a review of her Union Hospital North Shore Medical Center records indicates that this may have occurred in an urgent care appointment secondary to slurred speech and a recent fall and a nontrough level of According to her sister the patient has no shortterm memory She has been living in an assisted living facility and frequently calls her even right after she has left without remembering her visit The patient walks with a walker at baseline and goes out for dinner and shopping with her sister Ms Swanson also carries a diagnosis of atypical MS which she brought with her to Dr Billie According to Dr Nicole she has had stable deficits for many years without any flarelike episodes She had an MRI in that showed multiple plaquelike lesions but these were entirely stable since She is not undergoing any treatment

CSF negative blood cx NGTD urine cx lactobacillus CSF cytology NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS Reactive lymphoid cells immunotyping negative CXR No evidence for pneumonia No change since prior study of CT HEAD FINDINGS There is moderately severe confluent periventricular white matter hypodensity surrounding the frontal horns posterior horns and more superiorly involving the centra semiovale These findings are unchanged from prior studies and may relate to the atypical demyelinating process suggested in the indication on the prior MRI however they are nonspecific There is no evidence of acute intra or extra axial hemorrhage There is no shift of normally midline structures The ventricles are mildly prominent but are unchanged from the prior study There is no interval loss of focal gray white matter differentiation to suggest acute infarction though CT is not sensitive in the early stages No focal masses is seen IMPRESSION No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect no significant interval change from CT of Diffuse confluent periventricular white matter hypodensity which may relate to an underlying demyelinating process as suggested in the indication provided for the prior MRI The markedly low attenation HU centered within this process suggests either irreversible demyelination with cavitation black hole or lacunar infarction on a vascular basis Generalized and marked callosal atrophy on the MR also suggest advanced irreversible disease No mass is appreciated on this limited noncontrast study if clinically concerned an MRI with gadolinium is recommended MRI There is a similar configuration of increased T signal in the periventricular white matter of both cerebral hemispheres suggesting demyelinating disease As previously noted there is associated volume loss thinning of the corpus callosum and slight widening of the ventricles On postcontrast images there is a probably stable appearance of a mm linear focal area of enhancement in the left centrum semiovale of uncertain etiology Also ehancing is mm linear lesion in the left hippocampal cortex anteriorly not seen on the MR but that study was very motion degraded The hippocampus would be a most unusual site for involvement by multiple sclerosis There is no apparent mass lesion or mass effect No changes in the overall morphology of the brain are identified The surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable The major vascular flow patterns are normal IMPRESSION Stable appearance of confluent areas of increased T signal in the periventricular white matter consistent with severe demyelinating disease Enhancing lesions in the left centrum semiovale and also left hippocampal cortex This former lesion was evident on MR dating back to though is more prominent at this time likely due to less motion degradation of the current scan Etiology of these enhancing lesions is uncertain but could be atypical manifestations of demyelination EEG ABNORMALITY Throughout the recording there were frequent bursts of generalized theta and delta slowing Facial twitching was described by the technologist and seen on the video This is primarily rightsided facial movement clinically and did not appear to involve the forehead or CMED CSRU There were no clear EEG correlate ABNORMALITY The background voltages were occasionally lower on the left side and there were additional bursts of delta slowing seen broadly on the left side alone ABNORMALITY The background rhythms were dominated by much faster beta rhythm They appeared to reach an Hz frequency on the right at times though the background was disorganized and slow on both sides for much of the recording It was of much lower voltage on the left HYPERVENTILATION Could not be performed INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION Could not be performed SLEEP No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen CARDIAC MONITOR Showed a generally regular rhythm IMPRESSION Abnormal portable EEG due to the bursts of generalized slowing and additional leftsided slowing and voltage dimunition along with some slowing of the background The generalized and background features indicate a widespread encephalopathy The left sided slowing and voltage reduction surpassed an additional dysfunction on the left side possibly widespread cortical dysfunction There is a possibility of a structural lesion on the left but the encephalopathy dominated the overall picture There were no clear epileptiform discharges No EEG correlate was established for the facial twitching The lack of EEG correlate to the facial twitching does not exclude a central cause and indeed this appeared most likely based on the clinical and video observations Brief Hospital Course yo woman with ho seizure disorder demyelinating disease and brain injury presents with prolonged seizure now unresponsive with persistent twitching of right arm and face This is most consistent with complex partial seizures with a focus in the left hemisphere most likely the motor strip In the past her seizures were on the left side which implies that she now has a new focus It is possible that this is secondary to her underlying demyelinating disease but per report this has not been very active Other possibilities include infection including her UTI It is likely that these seizures began due to subtherapeutic dilantin levels on her new dose of mg mg Her seizure management is difficult given the higher doses were causing her to fall and slur her speech Discussed with Dr Joaquin the addition of an alternate Castelluccio with the possibility of tapering down the dilantin in the future and he agreed that she may benefit from zonegran Cannot use lamictal or depakote due to reactions Topamax is another possibility but not ideal in a patient with preexisting cognitive deficits She was started on zonegran at mg daily with plans to increase by mg every other week to a goal dose of mg day she was on mg daily at discharge and should have her dose increased on and again on She was continued on keppra and dilantin with trough checked frequently and adjustment as needed Ativan was used for breakthrough seizures facial twitching MRIMRA showed new temporal lesions but it is unclear if these are the cause or effect of her seizures She will need to have a repeat MRI in several months for further evaluation LP was done and had no changes to suggest a different etiology ie negative cytology and negative immunophenotyping Oligoclonal bands were not assessed as there was not enough CSF per the laboratory She will need repeated dilantin

Admission Date Discharge Date Date of Birth Sex F Service FICU HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS The patient is a yearold female with a history of breast cancer with known brain mets history of PE recent radiation therapy and steroids who presented in with myopathy presumed secondary to sterids which have been given for her brain mets She was later sent to rehab but returned early in April with increased cough with exertion with fever to She was treated with Levaquin given her temperatures and differential diagnosis of increased PE burden load infections or pneumonia and questionable lymphangitic spread of her cancer The patient did not experience improvement in her symptoms and was readmitted on with continued dyspnea and fevers Review of CTA showed no PE but there was ground glass opacities on CT so PCP was considered highly unlikely given her recent history of steroid use Her induced sputum was negative and BOL was done and also negative Sputum cultures were negative She was given Bactrim and she had improvement in the shortness of breath after her Bactrim was started and improved room air sats and was sent home on Bactrim She then continued to do poorly and then returned on She presented on clinic on with hypotension for which she was given intravenous fluids She spiked a fever to with blood pressures hypertensive into the systolic s and with rigors Chest xray showed a question of left lung opacity The patient was given Vancomycin and a gram of intravenous fluids Today the patient was found in the bathroom and became hypoxic with saturations in the s and was responsive to oxygen but was still tachypneic without improvement and was placed on nonrebreather Currently the patient is admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for further medical care Currently the patient is short of breath without chest pain or dysphagia PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Breast cancer left side diagnosed in status post mastectomy with out of positive lymph nodes She was treated with chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant and then later with Tamoxifen from to In she had mediastinal lymphadenopathy treated with Taxol and changed to Navelbine on She had diagnosed brain

grade temperature of tachycardic to hypotensive tachypneic into the s and s on nonrebreather In general she is extremely tachypneic difficulty in speaking words Her heart is regular without murmurs rubs or gallops slightly tachycardic Her pulmonary examination shows she has bronchial breath sounds with dry crackles at the bases Abdominal examination was benign Extremities no clubbing cyanosis or edema She is alert and following commands LABORATORY White blood cell count hematocrit platelets chemistry is potassium chloride bicarb BUN creatinine glucose Calcium phos magnesium She had a gas showing She had a CT from the th of her abdomen and pelvis showing marked increased consolidations at the left lung base and question of new left sided pleural effusion HOSPITAL COURSE Pulmonary The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for respiratory distress and febrile hypotension with a question of a new infiltrate on her chest xray The exact etiology of the patient s respiratory distress was presumed to be questionable multifactorial There was concern about possible pneumonia Also she had a history of PE and also there was concern about possible lymphangitic spread of her breast CA Given her fevers and shortness of breath the patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics initially started on Ceptaz Levaquin and and Clindamycin Lab two antibiotics were added considering the patient was thought to be a relatively high risk for PCP Douglas The patient was initially trialed on BiPAP but the patient was increasingly dyspneic increased respiratory stress and ultimately needed to be intubated on Earlier during her Intensive Care Unit course she underwent bronchoscopy which was sent for cytology and multiple bacterial pathogens all of which were negative Ultimately her Intensive Care Unit course continued and she began to defervesce and her bacterial studies particulaly from BAL lavage were found to be negative The patient had multiple antibiotics withdrawn Clindamycin and was discontinued early in hospital course Her PCP was thought to be negative In addition Vancomycin Levaquin were also discontinued She was later continued on Ceftazidine and Clindamycin for possible gram negative infection and also for possible post obstructive picture that she would be at risk for given her pulmonary anatomy As the Hubbard Regional Hospital hospital course went on the patient s respiratory did not show mild improvement on the ventilator She was able to oxygenate originally Unfortunately her mental status failed to improve despite having been off all sedative medications for several days Later in her Intensive Care Unit course family meetings took place and given the patient s overall poor prognosis with decreased mental status it was decided that the patient would become CMO Subsequently she was extubated on The patient continues to actually ventilate well off of the respiratory However she is CMO and will not be intubated for respiratory distress Cardiovascular The patient was initially transferred to the Intensive Care Unit thought to be exhibiting septic physiology respiratory distress and hypotensive She required aggressive intravenous fluids and later required pressor support with neosynephrine Later during her Intensive Care Unit course she was felt to be somewhat overloaded and intravenous fluids were cut back It was quite difficult weaning her off of neosynephrine She was also given stress dose steroids Later in her hospital course she also had an echocardiogram for question of new ECG findings in her inferior leads Her echocardiogram however was essentially normal with an ejection fraction of without any gross wall motion abnormalities or valvular pathology As mentioned above the patient s hemodynamic status was tenuous throughout her hospital course as it was difficult to wean the patient off of neosynephrine By however the patient had been off of neosynephrine but at this time as mentioned above the patient was deemed to be CMO per discussion with physicians and her husband health care proxy Hematology Patient with a history of known malignancy and also a history of pulmonary embolisms from Earlier in her Intensive Care Unit course the team was concerned about possible pulmonary embolisms as a possible source of the patient s respiratory decompensation However the patient also had brain metastasis and at this point anticoagulation was thought to be a contraindication given risk for hemorrhage into these tumors She did have lower extremity doppler ultrasounds which were negative Infectious disease As mentioned above patient initially hypotension febrile and in respiratory distress presumed to be septic source likely pulmonary Initially the patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin Ceptaz Levaquin Clindamycin and All of her cultures are negative to date She was negative for PCP and subsequently was continued and Clindamycin was changed for anaerobic coverage In addition her Vancomycin and Levaquin were also discontinued The patient remained afebrile during the majority of her hospital course By virtue of discussions on the patient was deemed to be CMO and all antibiotics were withdrawn at this point Gastroenterology The patient had an abdominal CT earlier in her Intensive Care Unit course which was essentially negative for an intraabdominal pathology She was initially supported with tube feeds during her Intensive Care Unit course but at this point the patient is CMO and tube feeds have been subsequently discontinued DISPOSITION The patient s attending physician was in constant communication with the patient s health care proxy her husband As her Intensive Care Unit course continued and the patient showed minimal signs of meaningful improvement continued discussions were had with the family about possibly changing code status Ultimately it was decided by that the patient had shown minimal improvement and minimal evidence of improvement status it was decided at this point for the patient to be extubated and to move toward CMO care Subsequently all antibiotics

neuropathy kidney transplantation in secondary to diabetic nephropathy as well as throat cancer in treated with local resection and radical neck dissection on the left as well as postoperative radiation Mr Mackey also had signs and symptoms consistent with cervical myelopathy a cervical MRI scan showed very impressive disc herniations at CC less so at CC with clear cut cord compression particularly on the right side CC Therefore he was admitted for CC and CC anterior diskectomy with autologous bone graft and instrumented fusion PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Postoperative physical examination demonstrated that he was afebrile at degrees blood pressure pulse respiratory rate on a nonrebreather He was awake alert uncomfortable secondary to incisional tenderness at neck site as well as right iliac graft site The wounds were clean dry and intact and flat HOSPITAL COURSE While in the PACU Anesthesia was called because the patient became dyspneic and tachypneic and his SAO dropped to His respiratory rate was on face mask Interoperatively he was positive two liters with a stable blood pressure and heart rate although requiring some neosynephrine interoperatively He responded to intravenous Lasix with liters of urine output as well as marked clinical improvement The etiology for his congestive heart failure was determined likely to be diastolic dysfunction from increased heart rate as well as excess volume No definite evidence for significant myocardial ischemia although cardiac enzymes were sent and he ruled out for myocardial infarction He was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where his respiratory and cardiac status was monitored carefully He was given Lasix to continue to diurese the excess volume He was also put on Lopressor mg twice a day Also in the Intensive Care Unit O saturation was closely monitored The patient became agitated with both tent and BiPAP machine although continued to saturate well He was transferred to Medicine the morning of for continued medical management post surgery On the day of transfer the patient was noted to be confused with waxing and waning sensorium thus a delirium workup was initiated looking for precipitants When his O saturation was monitored his pulse oximetry remained in the s during his stay His nonessential medications that may have been contributing to his change in mental status were discontinued those included Temocillin Nortriptyline Haldol Lorazepam Venlafaxine Bupropion and Gabapentin In addition his cyclosporin levels were checked Hypo or hyperglycemia Mahoney had been following with their appreciated recommendations on glucose control Finger sticks were in the s when acutely agitated therefore it was not determined that glucose levels were contributory Infectious causes were evaluated He was febrile in the Intensive Care Unit to F yet chest xray blood cultures urinalysis and urine cultures were all negative for sources A lumbar puncture was considered although not performed due to the fact that the cerebrospinal fluid was not breached during the procedure Mass effect was considered although no focal deficits were ever noted on examination and due to the fluctuating sensorium it was determined that there was no severe underlying structural abnormality A head and neck CT scan noncontrast were ordered though to evaluate for such processes No acute intracranial hemorrhages or midline shifts were noted although a soft tissue mass was noted at the level of C This was determined to be within the normal expected changes post surgery Trauma was also considered The patient was found out of bed but no signs of head trauma no loss of consciousness Throughout his stay Chem was monitored There were no electrolytes or mineral abnormalities that could explain his delirium Liver function tests were checked only total bilirubin was slightly elevated at TSH was within normal limits as was B and folate RPR evaluating for possible neurologic syphilis was also checked The assay was nonreactive An EEG was also considered to rule out nonconvulsive status epilepticus although again this did not seem to be a likely cause On the evening of the nd the patient became acutely agitated threatening to leave and also threatening to harm those nurses and physicians that were attempting to prevent him from leaving Security was notified who then arrived to the room and helped to place the patient in fourpoint restraints for the safety of both the patient and the staff of the hospital The restraints were weaned off overnight although he became acutely agitated and they were replaced early on Later in the morning on the patient was more oriented and alert and asked to have the restraints removed They were taken off two at a time The patient continued to do well and did not require restraints after that event Intramuscular as well as intravenous Haldol were ordered prn for emergency use should he become acutely agitated haldol as well as the restraints were not required after the morning of the rd Each progressive day Mr Donald delirium abated with return to baseline mental status early on The likely cause of the delirium was a combination of surgery and Intensive Care Unit stay in addition to polypharmacy Other concerns during his stay was his kidney function due to his renal transplant in His immunosuppressive therapy was continued throughout his stay his creatinine remained approximately to he has a baseline renal insufficiency With this in mind when obtaining a CT scan it was determined that contrast would not be the best option While the patient was in restraints gentle hydration was initiated since po intake was not adequate As for his diabetes mellitus the Mahoney Team provided updated recommendations each day adjusting for the changing po intake The only other complaints from Mr Mackey during his stay were Soreness at his operative sites for which he was given prn Tylenol once his delirium had resolved In addition he also complained of difficulty with swallowing necessitating only soft and liquid diet This was attributed to postoperative swelling and changes from his diskectomy performed DISPOSITION

diabetes asthma alcohol abuse and personality disorder depression admitted on for persistent hypoglycemia The patient complained of diaphoresis confusion dizziness lightheadedness after drinking a ounce beer and taking at least an extra units of NPH insulin the evening of later reported over U insulin administered from PM until time of presentation followed by not eating dinner His symptoms mildly improved after eating a candy bar The EMS was called and found his blood sugar at the time to be and noted to be in the Emergency Department He denied any seizure activity loss of consciousness incontinence shortness of breath fevers or chills chest pain change in urinary or bowel habits or suicidal ideation He has been depressed recently regarding stress with his home life and on the night of his extra insulin doses his wife had just kicked him out of the house He has had four past hospitalizations for attempted suicide with insulin overdosing usually denied The wife also states that he drinks more than he states In the Emergency Department he received amps of D and then D normal saline and D normal saline with blood sugars that were slow to increase leading the ICU team to suspect that the patient had taken more insulin than he admitted He also had a very positive tox screen for alcohol His fingersticks are currently in the s and his normal blood glucose at home ranges between per the patient The patient also now complains of increased right upper quadrant right rib cage pain and new headache He also complains of chronic photophobia which is unchanged He denied visual

negative for benzos barbiturates opiates cocaine amphetamines and methadone Telemetry was notable for episodes of sinus tachycardia to s to s only HOSPITAL COURSE HYPOGLYCEMIA The patient had been initially very hypoglycemic on admission secondary to overdosing on insulin however with glucose repletion both in the Emergency Department and in the ICU this resolved and the patient also began to eat We checked fingerstick glucoses qid and at am His glucose on the morning of discharge was about so we opted to decrease his pm NPH dose slightly for discharge and continue covering him with sliding scale insulin He should also continue having a snack at midnight if able It is likely that he required a much greater amount of insulin as an outpatient due to poor compliance with Richard Natalie diet ALCOHOL ABUSE It is likely that the patient continues to drink more than he admits He did have past alcoholism consisting of a half a pint of brandy per day for three years but supposedly had quit in He had been on a diazepam CIWA scale prophylaxis against DT s however he had a very low CIWA scale during his entire admission and did not need any benzodiazepines This alcohol abuse may be further addressed as an inpatient on the Psychiatry Quincy Medical Center We had also requested a Social Work consult regarding this DEPRESSION vs Borderline personality disorder The patient has had several admissions in the past for attempted suicide with overdose of his insulin and though he denied at this time attempting to end his life it appears that the social situation of increased stressors corresponding to this time suggest that this is not the truth He received a onetoone sitter during his admission and will be transferred to the Psychiatry HealthSouth New England Rehab Hospital to ensure the patient s safety and initiate further antidepressant treatment He will need close followup regarding his depression as an outpatient although apparently this has been set up for him in the past and he had not followed through HISTORY OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE His blood pressure was fairly low with a maximum of s systolic during his admission thus we did not continue his lisinopril which he had been on in the past RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT PAIN We obtained a right upper quadrant ultrasound as well as LFTs amylase and lipase which were all normal He had no evidence of cholecystitis or gallstones or any abnormalities with the liver or kidneys it is possible that he has had a muscle strain or other musculoskeletal cause PROPHYLAXIS He was put on Pepcid for GI prophylaxis FLUIDS ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION He complied with Linda Chad diet while hospitalized The patient was hyperphosphatemic secondary to overadministration of NeutraPhos during his ICU stay He

hospital day and she was gently diuresed On hospital day she experienced atrial fibrillation with HR in the s Her metoprolol dose was increased from mg PO bid to mg PO bid then mg PO tid Her HR decreased to ss Her BP remained stable An ECHO showed that she had preserved EF and no wall motion abnormalities We decided given her age that she would not be a good candidate for cardioversion for her afib nor would she be a good candidate for coumadin Therefore we will continue rate control with metoprolol this can be titrated if needed and aspirin and plavix for anticoagulation She should also continue on lipitor and lisinopril She should have her chem checked next week given the start of her new meds Will also need LFT s checked in months Pulmonary Bilateral crackles at bases and

catheterization at the end of October revealed a dilated aortic root to cm and stenosis of the mid left anterior descending at the bifurcation involving the diagonal branch stenoses of the left circumflex and oblique marginal artery and stenosis of the posterior descending artery His atrioventricular valve gradient was with an AV surface area of REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Review of systems shows that the patient denies any orthopnea paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea He has no bleeding or clotting problems Juanita does not feel any palpitations He does not have wheezing claudication or gastrointestinal bleeding Nor does he have any history of stroke like symptoms PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Hypercholesterolemia Type II diabetes Recent pneumonia Remote tobacco use Recent weight loss associated with the

day SOCIAL HISTORY He lives with his wife and works as a drug representative for Carvedilol PHYSICAL EXAMINATION On physical examination the patient is afebrile Weight is kilograms Blood pressure General Active welldeveloped wellnourished male Head and neck examination No bruits appreciated Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally Heart was regular rate and rhythm S and S systolic ejection murmur throughout his precordium His abdomen is soft nontender nondistended No hepatosplenomegaly and no CVA tenderness Extremities are warm well perfused no cyanosis clubbing or edema Palpable dorsalis pedis pulses No varicosities noted The patient was also noted to be right handed HOSPITAL COURSE He was admitted to the cardiac surgery service for an elected Bental procedure with homograft and coronary artery bypass graft Once consent and preoperative evaluation was complete he was taken to the operating room Please refer to the previously dictated operative note of by Dr Lawrence Briefly the patient was taken to the operating room to repair his critical aortic stenosis his coronary artery disease and his significantly dilated ascending aortic aneurysm The procedure was an aortic valve replacement with a tissue valve a coronary artery bypass graft procedure where five grafts were performed The left internal mammary artery was connected to the proximal left anterior descending and saphenous vein grafts were connected to the posterior descending artery diagonal branch obtuse marginal and distal left anterior descending Finally a super coronary arch graft was implanted This was a graft Cardiopulmonary bypass time was minutes His aorta was cross clamped for minutes He had pharmacologic circulatory arrest for minutes The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the unit intubated on Milrinone Levophed and Propofol drips The rest of the hospital stay can be discussed in terms of system based approach Pulmonary The patient remained intubated until postoperative day number five After that the patient had no major problems with his lungs His oxygen saturations remained good and he did not require supplemental oxygen more than a couple of days after his extubation He was sent to the floor from the cardiac surgery recovery unit on postoperative day number seven After an extended stay for hemodynamic monitoring and pressor support to maintain his perfusion Neurologic The major neurologic event of this hospital course was that the patient was slow to awake after his Propofol drip was discontinued Because of his confusion a neurology consult was obtained and subsequent radiographic imaging revealed chronic appearing infarcts in the right occipital lobe as well as both cerebellar hemispheres suggestive of more chronic infarcts as well as an area in the left corona radiata adjacent to the left lateral ventricle which may or may not be an acute infarct This was seen on the CAT scan on postoperative day number one As the patient became more awake he still remained somewhat confused and a little bit out of it In addition he was noted to have a right sided hemiplegia Over his postoperative course Mr Douglass has gradually been able to utilize more and more of his right side and with the assistance of physical therapy and occupational therapy he has to strength in his right hand and arm and about strength in his right leg He is able to walk about the floor on the days prior to discharge with the assistance of the physical therapist and nurses In addition Mr Douglass is given Trazodone to help him sleep at night A psychiatric consult was also obtained due to his mental status and confusion postoperatively but his psychiatric issues are mostly related to his neurologic insults and he has no distinctive psychiatric disorder except for perhaps postoperative delirium Cardiovascularly the patient did extremely well following the surgery The Levophed drip was continued until postoperative day number one Milrinone was continued until postoperative day number three at which point he was having good enough cardiac output that he did not need these drips to help maintain his blood pressure anymore He has remained without any chest pain following this procedure and his sternal wound is clean dry and intact at the end of the procedure In addition he has hypertension for which he receives Metoprolol and he has hypercholesterolemia for which he receives nothing at this time Pulmonary The patient remained intubated until postoperative day number five He was diuresed and was soon saturating very well on room air Gastrointestinal The patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease for which he has been receiving Zantac as an inpatient We will put him back on his Nexium In addition over the last couple of days prior to discharge the patient did appear a little bit icteric Liver function tests were obtained and they were slightly elevated liver function tests and ALT was AST was alkaline phosphatase was within normal limits Total bilirubin was Amylase was and lipase was A right upper quadrant ultrasound did not reveal any gallstones or common bile duct dilatation indicative of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis In addition the patient did have slightly elevated blood sugars over the last couple of days and has required an insulin sliding scale and basal insulin to maintain his blood sugars at a more appropriate level The ideal blood sugar levels for Mr Douglass in this postoperative period should be less than Please stay on top of the sliding scale so that the patient can keep a euglycemic level Hematologic The patient during this admission required transfusion of three units of packed red blood cells to maintain adequate hematocrit At the time of discharge Mr Norman hematocrit is at Fluids electrolytes and nutrition The patient did receive a significant amount of diuresis postoperatively and is well below his baseline with weight most likely because of his inability to eat because of his stroke Once he was coherent enough the patient was evaluated by the swallow team who declared him at first an aspiration risk As Mr Douglass has improved from his initial stroke he has become more lucid and is less of an aspiration risk On one day prior to discharge he was cleared by the swallow team to eat a diet as he wishes He is going out on a cardiac healthy diabetic diet as tolerated with Boost supplements Infectious disease The patient had positive blood and urine cultures on for history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus which was pan sensitive He was started on Oct for this bug On the patient s central venous line was discontinued The catheterization tip also grew out Serratia On the th a urine culture was obtained and did grow out greater than colonies of E coli which was intermittently resistant to Ciprofloxacin He was started on Bactrim for that Please continue Mr David Montero for one month to fight his blood borne infection to prevent seeding of his aortic graft and continue Bactrim for ten days after discharge to treat the E coli in his urine DISPOSITION Mr Douglass is being discharged on to a rehabilitation facility in good condition FOLLOWUP One to two weeks with his primary care physician and two to three weeks with his cardiologist and at one month with Dr Costello DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES Coronary artery disease status

causes No prominent focal abnormalities were evident and there were no epileptiform features The cardiac monitor showed occasional irregularities in a PACED rhythm Brief Hospital Course AP yo male with ho CAD TDM hyperlipidemia and COPD who presented to the Juan on with worsening SOB x days from Morton Hospital Medical Center Pt was initially admitted to CCU on transferred to Pendleton on triggered on for hypotension with BP and transferred back to CCU on He remained fluid overloaded and a swan catheter was placed The following issues were addressed during this hospital admission Cardiac Pump The patient was initially admitted for likely CHF exacerbation He was started on a lasix gtt the night of admission with a good response He continued to diurese and he was moved to the floor since he no longer required intensive level care While on the floor he continued to be diuresed After several days he became hypotensive and triggered for BPs ss He was given IVF without an adequate response in his pressures He was transferred back to the CCU and started on a dopamine gtt He diuresed well on the dopamine gtt and his BP was supported Gradually the dopamine gtt was weaned However he still appeared volume overloaded with minimal improvement in his oxygen requirement A swan was placed for a more accurate picture of his volume status and he was volume overloaded by swan numbers with an elevated PAD and elevated CVP without an obtainable wedge pressure He also had a high CO and low SVR suggestive of sepsis but he never had an elevated WBC and was afebrile during his entire hospital admission with negative blood urine wound and pleural fluid cultures The Lasix drip was eventually changed to IV Lasix boluses with a net diuresis of over liters for the hospital stay He was then transitioned to oral Lasix for maintainence The patient had an echo on with the results above in detail It was unchanged in comparison to with similar ventricular function and inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis The patient had another echo on with no new changes At discharge the patient was thought to be euvolemic satting well on room air and without peripheral edema His dry weight is kg Ischemia The patient had an initial troponin bump on admission which was most likely secondary to CHF exacerbation He was continued on Aspirin Metoprolol and Lipitor with no further issues Rhythm The patient is completely pacerdependent being epicardially paced at He is on Amiodarone for postop afib and this was continued this entire admission His underlying rhythm is atrial flutter it was unclear whether he had previously been cardioverted Anticoagulation was started with Warfarin mg with a goal of and a plan for cardioversion in weeks The patient s INR became supratherapeutic and Coumadin was held His coumadin was transitioned to mg and then mg His INR continued to flucuate He was discharged on mg but a stable regimen had not been achieved His INR will have to be monitored closely unitl his levels are stable His INR goal is SOB on admission Likely due to CHF exacerbation with diuresis of over L during his admission He had surgeries cardiac surgeries earlier in the summer so it is likely that he required copious IVF hydration surrounding these procedures which may have been the cause of his massive fluid overload It appears that his diet was regulated at rehab but there is concern for medication noncompliance at rehab per previous discharge summaries On discharge the patient was maintained on standing diuretics as well as PRN nebs and INH COPD meds Metabolic Alkalosis Hypochloremia Etiology most likely a combination of contraction alkalosis and or posthypercapnia This acutely worsened on when the patient was found to have mental status changes and an ABG revealed a CO of over likley due to a depressed respiratory drive secondary to sedatives given for agitation on top of a preexisting alkalosis The patient was therefore intubated for ventilation and continued to be diuresed His CO improved and he was extubated after a few days All sedating medications were held and serial ABGs were trended to follow the resolution of the metabolic alkalosis Pleural effusions sp right thoracentesis on mL of serosanguinous fluid removed from right pleural space Gram stain and cultures were negative cytology was negative The right pleural effusion slowly reaccumulated after tap but resolved after continued diuresis Repeat CXR showed improvement of the effusion and on discharge he had been breathing well on room air without complications TDM The patient was started on Glargine for tighter glycemic control and was covered with an insulin sliding scale He was monitored with QID fingersticks His blood sugars were in the s on discharge Hyperlipidemia The patient was continued on his statin COPD The patient was continued on nebs MS changes The patient has a history of baseline dementia which was confounded by delerium in the face of metabolic abnormalities His mental status improved as his metabolic process was resolved as detailed above Neurology was also consulted and a head CT showed old lacunar infarcts but no acute causes for a change in mental status An EEG showed mild encephalopathy but no other findings His mental status did clear somewhat with the addition of standing lactulose he was discharged on this medication Hypothyroidism The patient was continued on his outpatient dose of Levothyroxine UTI The patient was started on levofloxacin at NewtonWellesley Hospital for a question of UTI based on UA positive for WBC UCx during this hospitalization were negative and Levofloxacin was dc d Chronic lower back pain The patient was treated with a Lidocaine patch and Percocet prn Stronger narcotics were avoided given somnolence and MS changes Wound Care The patient has left chest wound and left gluteal pressure ulcer Wound care was consulted on and they made several recommendations For the left gluteal pressure ulcer they recommended gentle cleansing with normal saline or commercial wound cleaner thin layer of Duoderm gel air dry allevyn foam adhesive over the site and change every days or prn For the left chest wound they recommended cleansing with commercial wound cleanser pat dry pack aquacel AG rope and moisten with saline cover with dry gauze and change daily These recommendations were followed throughout the admission Voiding Pt failed multiple attempts to void on his own Case was discussed with neurology He was started on finsateride on the day prior to admission He is scheduled

VITAMIN D STATUS VITAMIN D HYDROXY ngmL DEFICIENCY INSUFFICIENCY SUFFICIENCY TOXICITY The biological function of Vitamin D is to maintain normal levels of calcium and phosphorus absorption Hydroxy vitamin D is the storage form of vitamin D Vitamin D assists in maintaining bone health by facilitating calcium absorption Vitamin D deficiency can also cause osteomalacia which frequently affects elderly patients Vitamin D Total levels are composed of two components namely Hydroxy Vitamin D and Hydroxy Vitamin D both of which are converted into active forms Vitamin D level corresponds with the exogenous dietary intake of Vitamin D rich foods as well as supplements Vitamin D level corresponds with endogenous production as well as exogenous diet and supplements Vitamin D from sunshine on the skin or from dietary intake is converted predominantly by the liver into hydroxy vitamin D which has a long halflife and is stored in the adipose tissue The metabolically active form of vitamin D dihydroxy vitamin D which has a short life is then synthesized in the kidney as needed from circulating hydroxy vitamin D The reference interval of greater than ngmL is a target value established by

ultrasound Abdominal aortic aneurysm seeAortic aneurysm Abdominal hernia seeHernia Abdominal thrust seeHeimlich maneuver Abdominal ultrasound Definition Ultrasound technology allows doctors to see inside a patient without resorting to surgery A transmitter sends high frequency sound waves into the bodywhere they bounce off the different tissues and organs toproduce a distinctive pattern of echoes A receiverhears the returning echo pattern and forwards it to acomputer which translates the data into an image on atelevision screen Because ultrasound can distinguishsubtle variations between soft fluidfilled tissues it isparticularly useful in providing diagnostic images of theabdomen Ultrasound can also be used in treatment Purpose The potential medical applications of ultrasound were first recognized in the s as an outgrowth of thesonar technology developed to detect submarines duringWorld War II The first useful medical images were produced in the early s and by ultrasound quality had improved to the point that it came into generalmedical use Improvements in the technology application and interpretation of ultrasound continue Its lowcost versatility safety and speed have brought it into thetop drawer of medical imaging techniquesWhile pelvic ultrasound is widely known and com monly used for fetal monitoring during pregnancy ultrasound is also routinely used for general abdominalimaging It has great advantage over xray imaging technologies in that it does not damage tissues with ionizingradiation Ultrasound is also generally far better thanplain x rays at distinguishing the subtle variations of softtissue structures and can be used in any of severalmodes depending on the need at hand As an imaging tool abdominal ultrasound generally is warranted for patients afflicted with chronic or acuteabdominal pain abdominal trauma an obvious or sus pected abdominal mass symptoms of liver disease pancreatic disease gallstones spleen disease kidney dis ease and urinary blockage or symptoms of an abdominalaortic aneurysm Specifically Abdominal pain Whether acute or chronic pain can signal a serious problemfrom organ malfunction orinjury to the presence of malignant growths Ultrasoundscanning can help doctors quickly sort through potential causes when presented with general or ambiguoussymptoms All of the major abdominal organs can bestudied for signs of disease that appear as changes insize shape and internal structure Abdominal trauma After a serious accident such as a car crash or a fall internal bleeding from injuredabdominal organs is often the most serious threat tosurvival Neither the injuries nor the bleeding areimmediately apparent Ultrasound is very useful as aninitial scan when abdominal trauma is suspected and itcan be used to pinpoint the location cause and severityof hemorrhaging In the case of puncture wounds f r o m a bullet for example ultrasound can locate the foreignobject and provide a preliminary survey of the damageThe easy portability and versatility of ultrasound technology has brought it into common emergency roomuse and even into limited ambulance service Abdominal mass Abnormal growthstumors cysts abscesses scar tissue and accessory organscan beA GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE GEM to A PM Page located and tentatively identified with ultrasound In particular potentially malignant solid tumors can bedistinguished from benign fluidfilled cysts andabscesses Masses and malformations in any organ orpart of the abdomen can be found Liver disease The types and underlying causes of liver disease are numerous though jaundice tends to be a general symptom Ultrasound can differentiate betweenmany of the types and causes of liver malfunction andis particularly good at identifying obstruction of thebile ducts and cirrhosis which is characterized by abnormal fibrous growths and reduced blood flow Pancreatic disease Inflammation and malformation of the pancreas are readily identified by ultrasound as arepancreatic stones calculi which can disrupt properfunctioning Gallstones Gallstones cause more hospital admissions than any other digestive malady These calculi cancause painful inflammation of the gallbladder and alsoobstruct the bile ducts that carry digestive enzymesfrom the gallbladder and liver to the intestines Gallstones are readily identifiable with ultrasound Spleen disease The spleen is particularly prone to injury during abdominal trauma It may also becomepainfully inflamed when beset with infection orcancer These conditions also lend themselves well to ultrasonic inspection and diagnosis Kidney disease The kidneys are also prone to traumatic injury and are the organs most likely to form calculiwhich can block the flow of urine and cause blood poi soning uremia A variety of diseases causing distinct changes in kidney morphology can also lead to complete kidney failure Ultrasound imaging has provenextremely useful in diagnosing kidney disorders Abdominal aortic aneurysm This is a bulging weak spot in the abdominal aorta which supplies blooddirectly from the heart to the entire lower body Theseaneurysms are relatively common and increase inprevalence with age A burst aortic aneurysm is imminently lifethreatening However they can be readilyidentified and monitored with ultrasound before acutecomplications result Ultrasound technology can also be used for treat ment purposes most frequently as a visual aid duringsurgical proceduressuch as guiding needle placementto drain fluid from a cyst or to extract tumor cells forbiopsy Increasingly direct therapeutic applications forultrasound are being developed The direct therapeutic value of ultrasonic waves lies in their mechanical nature They are shock waves just likeaudible sound and vibrate the materials through whichthey pass These vibrations are mild virtually unnotice able at the frequencies and intensities used for imagingProperly focused however highintensity ultrasound canbe used to heat and physically agitate targeted tissues Highintensity ultrasound is used routinely to treat soft tissue injuries such as strains tears and associatedscarring The heating and agitation are believed to promote rapid healing through increased circulation Strongly focused highintensity highfrequency ultrasound canalso be used to physically destroy certain types oftumors as well as gallstones and other types of calculiDeveloping new treatment applications for ultrasound isan active area of medical research Precautions Properly performed ultrasound imaging is virtually without risk or side effects Some patients report feelinga slight tingling andor warmth while being scanned butmost feel nothing at all Ultrasound waves of appropriatefrequency and intensity are not known to cause or aggravate any medical condition though any woman whothinks she might be pregnant should raise the issue withher doctor before undergoing an abdominal ultrasound The value of ultrasound imaging as a medical tool however depends greatly on the quality of the equipmentused and the skill of the medical personnel operating itImproperly performed andor interpreted ultrasound canbe worse than useless if it indicates that a problem existswhere there is none or fails to detect a significant condition Basic ultrasound equipment is relatively inexpensive to obtain and any

the brain CT scans are thechief competitor to ultrasound and can yield higherquality images not disrupted by bone or gas Theyare however more cumbersome time consumingand expensive to perform and they use ionizing electromagnetic radiation Doppler The Doppler effect refers to the apparent change in frequency of sound wave echoes returningto a stationary source from a moving target If theobject is moving toward the source the frequencyincreases if the object is moving away the frequency decreases The size of this frequency shift can beused to compute the objects speedbe it a car onthe road or

ultrasound waves produce more detailed images but are also more readily absorbed andso cannot penetrate as deeply into the body Abdominalultrasound imaging is generally performed at frequenciesbetween MHz An ultrasound machine consists of two parts the transducer and the analyzer The transducer both producesthe sound waves that penetrate the body and receives thereflected echoes Transducers are built around piezoelectric ceramic chips Piezoelectric refers to electricity thatis produced when you put pressure on certain crystalssuch as quartz These ceramic chips react to electric pulses by producing sound waves they are transmittingwaves and react to sound waves by producing electricpulses receiving Bursts of high frequency electric pulses supplied to the transducer causes it to produce thescanning sound waves The transducer then receives thereturning echoes translates them back into electric pulsesand sends them to the analyzera computer that organizes the data into an image on a television screen Because sound waves travel through all the bodys tissues at nearly the same speedabout miles perhourthe microseconds it takes for each echo to bereceived can be plotted on the screen as a distance into thebody The relative strength of each echo a function of thespecific tissue or organ boundary that produced it can beplotted as a point of varying brightness In this way theechoes are translated into a picture Tissues surroundedby bone or filled with gas the stomach intestines andbowel cannot be imaged using ultrasound because thewaves are blocked or become randomly scattered Four different modes of ultrasound are used in med ical imaging Amode This is the simplest type of ultrasound in which a single transducer scans a line through the bodywith the echoes plotted on screen as a function ofdepth This method is used to measure distances withinthe body and the size of internal organs Therapeuticultrasound aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is alsoAmode to allow for pinpoint accurate focus of thedestructive wave energy Bmode In Bmode ultrasound a linear array of trans ducers simultaneously scans a plane through the bodythat can be viewed as a twodimensional image onscreen Ultrasound probes containing more than transducers in sequence form the basis for these mostcommonly used scanners which cost about MMode The M stands for motion A rapid sequence of Bmode scans whose images follow each other insequence on screen enables doctors to see and measure range of motion as the organ boundaries thatproduce reflections move relative to the probe Mmode ultrasound has been put to particular use in studying heart motion Doppler mode Doppler ultrasonography includes the capability of accurately measuring velocities of movingmaterial such as blood in arteries and veins The principle is the same as that used in radar guns that measurethe speed of a car on the highway Doppler capability ismost often combined with Bmode scanning to produceimages of blood vessels from which blood flow can bedirectly measured This technique is used extensively toinvestigate valve defects arteriosclerosis and hyper tension particularly in the heart but also in the abdom inal aorta and the portal vein of the liver Thesemachines cost about The actual procedure for a patient undergoing an abdominal ultrasound is relatively simple regardless ofthe type of scan or its purpose Fasting for at least eight hours prior to the procedure ensures that the stomach isempty and as small as possible and that the intestinesand bowels are relatively inactive Fasting also allows thegall bladder to be seen as it contracts after eating andmay not be seen if the stomach is full In some cases afull bladder helps to push intestinal folds out of the wayso that the gas they contain does not disrupt the imageThe patients abdomen is then greased with a special gelthat allows the ultrasound probe to glide easily across theskin while transmitting and receiving ultrasonic pulses This procedure is conducted by a doctor with the assistance of a technologist skilled in operating theequipment The probe is moved around the abdomen toobtain different views of the target areas The patient willlikely be asked to change positions from side to side andto hold their breath as necessary to obtain the desiredviews Discomfort during the procedure is minimal The many types and uses of ultrasound technology makes it difficult to generalize about the time and costsinvolved Relatively simple imagingscanning a suspicious abdominal mass or a suspected abdominal aorticaneurysmwill take about half an hour to perform andwill cost a few hundred dollars or more depending onthe quality of the equipment the operator and other factors More involved techniques such as multiple Mmodeand Dopplerenhanced scans or cases where the targetsnot well defined in advance generally take more timeand are more expensive Regardless of the type of scan used and the potential

the stomach or intestines to protrude GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Abdominal wall defectsGEM to A PM Page Description Many unexpected and fascinating events occur dur ing the development of a fetus inside the womb Thestomach and intestines begin development outside thebabys abdomen and only later does the abdominal wallenclose them Occasionally either the umbilical openingis too large or it develops improperly allowing the bowels or stomach to remain outside or squeeze through theabdominal wall Causes and symptoms There are many causes for birth defects that still remain unclear Presently the causes of abdominal walldefects is unknown and any symptoms the mother mayhave to indicate that the defects are present in the fetusare nondescript Diagnosis At birth the problem is obvious because the base of the umbilical cord at the navel will bulge or in worsecases contain viscera internal organs Before birth anultrasound examination may detect the problem It isalways necessary in children with one birth defect to lookfor others because birth defects are usually multiple Treatment Abdominal wall defects are effectively treated with surgical repair Unless there are accompanying anomalies the surgical procedure is not overly complicatedThe organs are normal just misplaced However if thedefect is large it may be difficult to fit all the viscera intothe small abdominal cavity Prognosis If there are no other defects the prognosis after sur gical repair of this condition is relatively good HoweverKEY TERMS Hernia Movement of a structure into a place it does not belong Umbilical Referring to the opening in the abdominal wall where the blood vessels from theplacenta enter Viscera Any of the bodys organs located in the chest or abdomen of those with more

intact removal of a fetus This procedure is mostcommonly referred to as intact dilatation and extractionD X Purpose Partial birth abortion or DX is performed to end a pregnancy and results in the death of a fetus typically in GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Abortion partial birthGEM to A PM Page the late second or third trimester Although DX is high ly controversial some physicians argue that it has advantages that make it a preferable procedure in some circumstances One perceived advantage is that the fetus isremoved largely intact allowing for better evaluation andautopsy of the fetus in cases of known fetal anomalies Intact removal of the fetus may also confer a lower riskof puncturing the uterus or damaging the cervix Anotherperceived advantage is that DX ends the pregnancywithout requiring the woman to go through labor whichmay be less emotionally traumatic than other methods oflateterm abortion In addition DX may offer a lowercost and shorter procedure time Precautions Women considering DX should be aware of the highly controversial nature of this procedure A controversy common to all lateterm abortions is whether thefetus is viable or able to survive outside of the womansbody A specific area of controversy with DX is thatfetal death does not occur until after most of the fetalbody has exited the uterus Several states have takenlegal action to limit or ban DX and many physicianswho perform abortions do not perform DX This mayrestrict the availability of this procedure to women seeking lateterm abortion Description Intact DX or partial birth abortion first involves administration of medications to cause the cervix todilate usually over the course of several days Next thephysician rotates the fetus to a footling breech positionThe body of the fetus is then drawn out of the uterus feetfirst until only the head remains inside the uterus Thenthe physician uses an instrument to puncture the base ofthe skull which collapses the fetal head Typically thecontents of the fetal head are then partially suctioned outwhich results in the death of the fetus and reduces thesizes of the fetal head enough to allow it to pass throughthe cervix The dead and otherwise intact fetus is thenremoved from the womans body Preparation Medical preparation for DX involves an outpatient visit to administer medications such as laminaria t o cause the cervix to begin dilating In addition preparation may involve fulfilling local legal requirements such as a mandatory waiting periodcounseling or an informed consent procedure reviewingstages of fetal development

abortion also known as selective reduc tion refers to choosing to abort a fetus typically in amultifetal pregnancy to decrease the health risks to the mother in carrying and giving birth to more than one ortwo babies and also to decrease the risk of complicationsto the remaining fetuses The term selective abortionalso refers to choosing to abort a fetus for reasons such asthe woman is carrying a fetus which likely will be bornwith some birth defect or impairment or because the sexof the fetus is not preferred by the individual Purpose A woman may decide to abort for health reasons for example she is at higher risk for complications during pregnancy because of a disorder or disease such as diabetes However selective reduction is recommended often in cases of multifetal pregnancy or the presence of more thanone fetus typically at least three or more fetuses In thegeneral population multifetal pregnancy happens in onlyabout of pregnant women But multifetal pregnancies occur far more often in women using fertility drugs Precautions Because women or couples who use fertility drugs have made an extra effort to become pregnant it is possible that the individuals may be unwilling or uncomfortable with the decision to abort a fetus in cases of multifetal pregnancy Individuals engaging in fertility treatment should be made aware of the risk of multifetalpregnancy and consider the prospect of recommendedreduction before undergoing fertility treatment Description Selective reduction is usually performed between nine and weeks of pregnancy and is most successfulwhen performed in early pregnancy It is a simple procedure and can be performed on an outpatient basis A needle is inserted into the womans stomach or vagina andpotassium chloride is injected into the fetus Preparation Individuals who have chosen selective reduction to safeguard the remaining fetuses should be counseledprior to the procedure Individuals should receive information regarding the risks of a multifetal pregnancy toboth the fetuses and the mother compared with the risksafter the reduction Individuals seeking an abortion for any reason should consider the ethical implications whether it bebecause the fetus is not the preferred sex or because thefetus would be born with a severe birth defect Aftercare Counseling should continue after the abortion because it is a traumatic event Individuals may feelguilty about choosing one fetus over another Mentalhealth professionals should be consulted throughout theprocess Risks About of women who undergo selective reduc tion will go into premature labor About of women undergoing selective reduction also miscarry oneor more of the remaining fetuses The risks associatedwith multifetal pregnancy is considered higher Normal results In cases where a

menstrual extraction Thisprocedure is also sometimes called menstrual regulationminisuction or preemptive abortion The contents of theuterus are suctioned out through a thin mm plastictube that is inserted through the undilated cervix Suctionis applied either by a bulb syringe or a small pump Another method is called the morning after pill or emergency contraception Basically it involves taking high doses of birth control pills within to hours ofhaving unprotected sex The high doses of hormonescauses the uterine lining to change so that it will not support a pregnancy Thus if the egg has been fertilized it issimply expelled from the body There are two types of emergency contraception One type is identical to ordinary birth control pills anduses the hormones estrogen and progestin This type isavailable with a prescription under the brand name Preven But women can even use their regular birth controlpills for emergency contraception after they check withtheir doctor about the proper

effectiveness decreases after the seventh week The procedure may require multiple visits to the doctor Bleeding after the abortion lasts longer than after a sur gical abortion The woman may see the contents of her womb as it is expelled Two different medications can be used to bring about an abortion Methotrexate Rheumatrex works by stopping fetal cells from dividing which causes the fetus to die On the first visit to the doctor the woman receives an injection of methotrexate On the second visit abouta week later she is given misoprostol Cytotec anoxygenated unsaturated cyclic fatty acid responsible forvarious hormonal reactions such as muscle contractionprostaglandin that stimulates contractions of theuterus Within two weeks the woman will expel thecontents of her uterus ending the

Abscess Definition An abscess is an enclosed collection of liquefied tis sue known as pus somewhere in the body It is the resultof the bodys defensive reaction to foreign material GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AbcessGEM to A PM Page Description There are two types of abscesses septic and sterile Most abscesses are septic which means that they are theresult of an infection Septic abscesses can occur anywhere in the body Only a germ and the bodys immuneresponse are required In response to the invading germwhite blood cells gather at the infected site and beginproducing chemicals called enzymes that attack the germby digesting it These enzymes act like acid killing thegerms and breaking them down into small pieces that canbe picked up by the circulation and eliminated from thebody Unfortunately these chemicals also digest bodytissues In most cases the germ produces similar chemicals The result is a thick yellow liquidpuscontaining digested germs digested tissue white blood cellsand enzymes An abscess is the last stage of a tissue infection that begins with a process called inflammation Initially asthe invading germ activates the bodys immune systemseveral events occur Blood flow to the area increases The temperature of the area increases due to the increased blood supply The area swells due to the accumulation of water blood and other liquids It turns red It hurts because of the irritation from the swelling and the chemical activity These four signsheat swelling redness and pain characterize inflammation As the process progresses the tissue begins to turn to liquid and an abscess forms It is the nature of anabscess to spread as the chemical digestion liquefiesmore and more tissue Furthermore the spreading follows the path of least resistancethe tissues most easilydigested A good example is an abscess just beneath theskin It most easily continues along beneath the skinrather than working its way through the skin where itcould drain its toxic contents The contents of the abscessalso leak into the general circulation and produce symptoms just like any other infection These include chillsfever aching and general discomfort Sterile abscesses are sometimes a milder form of the same process caused not by germs but by nonliving irritants such as drugs If an injected drug like penicillin isnot absorbed it stays where it was injected and maycause enough irritation to generate a sterile abscesssterile because there is no infection involved Sterileabscesses are quite likely to turn into hard solid lumps asthey scar rather than remaining pockets of pusCauses and symptoms Many different agents cause abscesses The most common are the pusforming pyogenic bacteria likeStaphylococcus aureus which is nearly always the cause of abscesses under the skin Abscesses near the largebowel particularly around the anus may be caused byany of the numerous bacteria found within the largebowel Brain abscesses and liver abscesses can be causedby any

that contains pus may need to be drained via a cut if it does not respond to antibiotics This allows the pus to escape and the infection to heal Purpose An abscess is a pusfilled sore usually caused by a bacterial infection The pus is made up of both live anddead organisms and destroyed tissue from the whiteblood cells that were carried to the area to fight the infection Abscesses are often found in the soft tissue underthe skin such as the armpit or the groin However theymay develop in any organ and are commonly found inthe breast and gums Abscesses are far more serious andcall for more specific treatment if they are located indeep organs such as the lung liver or brain Because the lining of the abscess cavity tends to interfere with the amount of the drug that can penetratethe

insert a drainage tube after cleaning out the wound Once the tube isin place the surgeon closes the incision with simple stitches and applies a sterile dressing Drainage is maintained forseveral days to help prevent the abscess from reforming Preparation The skin over the abscess will be cleansed by swab bing gently with an antiseptic solution Aftercare Much of the pain around the abscess will be gone after the surgery Healing is usually very fast After thetube is taken out antibiotics may be continued for several days Applying heat and keeping the affected area elevated may help relieve

Physical abuse of a child is the infliction of injury by an other person The injuries can include punching kicking biting burning beating or pulling the victims hairThe physical abuse inflicted on a child can result inbruises burns poisoning broken bones and internal hemorrhages Physical assault against an adult primarilyoccurs with women usually in the form of domestic violence It is estimated that approximately three millionchildren witness domestic violence every year Sexual abuse of a child refers to sexual behavior between an adult and child or between two children oneof whom is dominant or significantly older The sexualbehaviors can include touching breasts genitals and buttocks either dressed or undressed The behavior can alsoinclude exhibitionism cunnilingus fellatio or penetration of the vagina or anus with sexual organs or objects Pornographic photography is also used in sexual abuse with children Reported sex offenders are male Females are more often perpetrators in childcaresettings since children may confuse sexual abuse by afemale with normal hygiene care Sexual abuse by stepfathers is five times more common than with biologicalfathers Sexual abuse of daughters by stepfathers orfathers is the most common form of incest Sexual abuse can also take the form of rape The legal definition of rape includes only slight penile penetration in the victims

in failure to fulfill obligations at home work or school using substance in situations that are physically danger ous ie while driving recurrent substancerelated legal problems continued usage despite recurrent social and interper sonal problems ie arguments and fights with significant other Abuse in the elderly is common and occurs mostly as a result of caretaker burnout due to the high level ofdependency frail elderly patients usually require Abusecan be manifested by physical signs fear and delayingor not reporting the need for advanced medical careElderly patients may also exhibit financial abuse moneyor possessions taken away and abandonment Emotional abuse generally continues even after phys ical assaults have stopped In most cases it is a personallytailored form of verbal or

occur at the same time A large percentage of sexually assaulted persons were also physically abused in theform of punching beating or threatening the victim witha weapon such as a gun or knife Usually males who arehurt and humiliated tend to physical assault personswhom they are intimately involved with such as spousesandor children Males who assault a female tend to haveexperienced or witnessed violence during childhoodThey also tend to abuse alcohol to be sexually assaultiveand are at increased risk for assaultive behavior directedagainst children Jealous males tend to monitor thewomens movements and whereabouts and to isolateother sources of protection and support They interprettheir behavior as betrayal of trust and this causes resentment and explosive anger outbursts during periods of losing control Males may also use aggression againstfemales in an effort to control and intimidate partners Abuse in the elderly usually occurs in the frail elderly community The caretaker is usually the perpetrator Caretaker abuse can be suspected if there is evidence suggesting behavioral changes in the elderly person when thecaretaker is present Additionally elderly abuse can bepossible if there are delays between injuries and treatmentinconsistencies between injury and explanations lack ofhygiene or clothing and prescriptions no being filled Diagnosis Children who are

Achalasia is a disorder of the esophagus that pre vents normal swallowing Description Achalasia affects the esophagus the tube that carries swallowed food from the back of the throat down into thestomach A ring of muscle called the lower esophagealsphincter encircles the esophagus just above the entrance tothe stomach This sphincter muscle is normally contractedto close the esophagus When the sphincter is closed thecontents of the stomach cannot flow back into the esophagus Backward flow of stomach contents reflux can irritate and inflame the esophagus causing symptoms such asheartburn The act of swallowing causes a wave of esophageal contraction called peristalsis Peristalsis pushesfood along the esophagus Normally peristalsis causes theesophageal sphincter to relax and allow food into the stomach In achalasia which means failure to relax theesophageal sphincter remains contracted Normal peristalsis is interrupted and food cannot enter the stomach Causes and symptoms Causes Achalasia is caused by degeneration of the nerve cells that normally signal the brain to relax theesophageal sphincter The ultimate cause of this degeneration is unknown Autoimmune disease or hidden infection is suspected Symptoms Dysphagia or difficulty swallowing is the most com mon symptom of achalasia The person with achalasia usually has trouble swallowing both liquid and solid foodsoften feeling that food gets stuck on the way down Theperson has chest pain that is often mistaken for angina pectoris cardiac pain Heartburn and difficulty belchingare common Symptoms usually get steadily worse Othersymptoms may include nighttime cough or recurrent pneumonia caused by food passing into the lower airways Diagnosis Diagnosis of achalasia begins with a careful medical history The history should focus on the timing of symptoms and on eliminating other medical conditions thatmay cause similar symptoms Tests used to diagnoseachalasia include Esophageal manometry In this test a thin tube is passed into the esophagus to measure the pressureexerted by the esophageal sphincter X ray of the esophagus Barium may be swallowed to act as a contrast agent Barium reveals the outlines ofthe esophagus in greater detail and makes it easier tosee its constriction at the sphincter Endoscopy In this test a tube containing a lens and a light source is passed into the esophagus Endoscopy isused to look directly at the surface of the esophagusThis test can also detect tumors that cause symptomslike those of achalasia Cancer of the esophagus occurs as a complication of achalasia in of patients Treatment The firstline treatment for achalasia is balloon dila tion In this procedure an inflatable membrane or balloon is passed down the esophagus to the sphincter andinflated to force the sphincter open Dilation is effectivein about of patients Three other treatments are used for achalasia when balloon dilation is inappropriate or unacceptable Botulinum toxin injection Injected into the sphincter botulinum toxin paralyzes the muscle and allows it torelax Symptoms usually return within one to two years Esophagomyotomy This surgical procedure cuts the sphincter muscle to allow the esophagus to openEsophagomyotomy is becoming more popular with thedevelopment of techniques allowing very small abdominal incisions Drug therapy Nifedipine a calciumchannel blocker reduces muscle contraction Taken daily this drug provides relief for about twothirds of patients for as longas two years Prognosis Most patients with achalasia can be treated effective ly Achalasia does not reduce

in which the development of cartilage and therefore bone is disturbed The disorder appears in approximately one in every births Achondroplasia isusually diagnosed at birth owing to the characteristicappearance of the newborn Normal bone growth depends on the production of cartilage a fibrous connective tissue Over time calcium is deposited within the cartilage causing it to harden and become bone In achondroplasia abnormalitiesof this process prevent the bones especially those inthe limbs from growing as long as they normallyshould at the same time allowing the bones to becomeabnormally thickened The bones in the trunk of thebody and the skull are mostly not affected although theopening from the skull through which the spinal cordpasses foramen magnum is often narrower than normal and the opening spinal canal through which thespinal cord runs in the back bones vertebrae becomesincreasingly and abnormally small down the length ofthe spine Causes and symptoms

specific chemical reactions Acid phosphatase testing is done to diagnosewhether prostate cancer has spread to other parts of the body metastasized and to check the effectiveness oftreatment The test has been largely supplanted by theprostate specific antigen test PSA Purpose The male prostate gland has times more acid phosphatase than any other body tissue When prostatecancer spreads to other parts of the body acid phos phatase levels rise particularly if the cancer spreads tothe bone Onehalf to threefourths of persons who havemetastasized prostate cancer have high acid phosphataselevels Levels fall after the tumor is removed or reducedthrough treatment Tissues other than prostate have small amounts of acid phosphatase including bone liver spleen kidneyand red blood cells and platelets Damage to these tissuescauses a moderate increase in acid phosphatase levels Acid phosphatase is very concentrated in semen Rape investigations will often include testing for thepresence of acid phosphatase in vaginal fluid Precautions This is not a screening test for prostate cancer Acid phosphatase levels rise only after prostate cancer hasmetastasized Description Laboratory testing measures the amount of acid phosphatase in a persons blood and can determine fromwhat tissue the enzyme is coming For example it isimportant to know if the increased acid phosphatase isfrom the prostate or red blood cells Acid phosphatasefrom the prostate called prostatic acid phosphatasePAP is the most medically significant type of acidphosphataseKEY TERMS Enzyme A substance needed to trigger specific chemical reactions Metastasize Spread to other parts of the body usually refers to cancer Prostate gland A gland of the male reproductive system Subtle differences between prostatic acid phos phatase and acid phosphatases from other tissues causethem to react differently in the laboratory when mixedwith certain chemicals For example adding the chemical tartrate to the test mixture inhibits the activity of prostatic acid phosphatase but not red blood cell acid phosphatase Laboratory test methods based on these differences reveal how much of a persons total acid phosphatase is derived from the prostate Results are usuallyavailable the next day Preparation This test requires drawing about mL of blood The patient should not have a rectal exam or prostatemassage

stops willreduce bruising Warm packs to the puncture site willrelieve discomfort Normal results Normal results vary based on the laboratory and the method used Abnormal results The highest levels of acid phosphatase are found in metastasized prostate cancer Diseases of the bone suchas Pagets disease or hyperparathyroidism diseases of blood cells such as sickle cell disease or multiple myeloma or

mild acne It is also found in some newborns The sebaceous glands lie just beneath the skins sur face They produce an oil called sebum the skins naturalmoisturizer These glands and the hair follicles withinwhich they are found are called sebaceous folliclesThese follicles open onto the skin through pores Atpuberty increased levels of androgens male hormonescause the glands to produce too much sebum Whenexcess sebum combines with dead sticky skin cells ahard plug or comedo forms that blocks the pore Mildnoninflammatory acne consists of the two types of comedones whiteheads and blackheads Moderate and severe inflammatory types of acne result after the plugged follicle is invaded by Propioni bacterium acnes a bacteria that normally lives on theskin A pimple forms when the damaged follicle weakens and bursts open releasing sebum bacteria and skin andwhite blood cells into the surrounding tissues Inflamedpimples near the skins surface are called papules whendeeper they are called pustules The most severe type ofacne consists of cysts closed sacs and nodules hardswellings Scarring occurs when new skin cells are laiddown to replace damaged cells The most common sites of acne are the face chest shoulders and back since these are the parts of the bodywhere the most sebaceous follicles are found Causes and symptoms The exact cause of acne is unknown Several risk factors

sheath that surrounds the vestibulocochlear nerve eighth cranial nerve Description The vestibulocochlear nerve extends from the inner ear to the brain and is made up of a vestibular branchoften called the vestibular nerve and a cochlear branchcalled the cochlear nerve The vestibular and cochlearnerves lie next to one another They also run along sideother cranial nerves People possess two of each type ofvestibulocochlear nerve one that extends from the leftear and one that extends from the right ear The vestibular nerve transmits information concern ing balance from the inner ear to the brain and the cochlearnerve transmits information about hearing The vestibularnerve like many nerves is surrounded by a cover called amyelin sheath A tumor called a schwannoma can sometimes develop from the cells of the myelin sheath A tumoris an abnormal growth of tissue that results from theuncontrolled growth of cells Acoustic neuromas are oftencalled vestibular schwannomas because they are tumorsthat arise from the myelin sheath that surrounds thevestibular nerve Acoustic neuromas are consideredbenign noncancerous tumors since they do not spread toother parts of the body They can occur anywhere alongthe vestibular nerve but are most likely to occur where thevestibulocochlear nerve passes through the tiny bony canalthat connects the brain and the inner ear An acoustic neuroma can arise from the left vestibu lar nerve or the right vestibular nerve A unilateral tumoris a tumor arising from one nerve and a bilateral tumorarises from both vestibular nerves Unilateral acousticneuromas usually occur spontaneously by chance Bilateral acoustic neuromas occur as part of a hereditary con GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Acoustic neuromaGEM to A PM Page dition called Neurofibromatosis Type NF A person with NF has inherited a predisposition for developingacoustic neuromas and other tumors of the nerve cells Acoustic neuromas usually grow slowly and can take years to develop Some acoustic neuromas remainso small that they do not cause any symptoms As theacoustic neuroma grows it can interfere with the functioning of the vestibular nerve and can cause vertigo andbalance difficulties If the acoustic nerve grows largeenough to press against the cochlear nerve then hearing lossand a ringing tinnitus in the affected ear will usu ally occur If untreated and the acoustic neuroma continues to grow it can press against other nerves in the regionand cause other symptoms This tumor can be life threatening if it becomes large enough to press against andinterfere with the functioning of the brain Causes and symptoms Causes An acoustic neuroma is caused by a change or absence of both of the NF tumor suppressor genes in anerve cell Every person possesses a pair of NF genes inevery cell of their body including their nerve cells OneNF gene is inherited from the egg cell of the mother andone NF gene is inherited from the sperm cell of thefather The NF gene is responsible for helping to prevent the formation of tumors in the nerve cells In particular the NF gene helps to prevent acoustic neuromas Only one unchanged and functioning NF gene is necessary to prevent the formation of an acoustic neuroma If both NF genes become changed or missing inone of the myelin sheath cells of the vestibular nervethen an acoustic neuroma will usually develop Most unilateral acoustic neuromas result when the NF genesbecome spontaneously changed or missing Someonewith a unilateral acoustic neuroma that has developedspontaneously is not at increased risk for having childrenwith an acoustic neuroma Some unilateral acoustic neuromas result from the hereditary condition NF It is alsopossible that some unilateral acoustic neuromas may becaused by changes in other genes responsible for preventing the formation of tumors Bilateral acoustic neuromas result when someone is affected with the hereditary condition NF A person withNF is typically born with one unchanged and onechanged or missing NF gene in every cell of their bodySometimes they inherit this change from their mother orfather Sometimes the change occurs spontaneously whenthe egg and sperm come together to form the first cell ofthe baby The children of a person with NF have a chance of inheriting the changed or missing NF geneA person with NF will develop an acoustic neuro ma if the remaining unchanged NF gene becomes spontaneously changed or missing in one of the myelin sheathcells of their vestibular nerve People with NF oftendevelop acoustic neuromas at a younger age The meanage of onset of acoustic neuroma in NF is years ofage versus years of age for sporadic acoustic neuromas Not all people with NF however develop acousticneuromas People with NF are at increased risk fordeveloping cataracts and tumors in other nerve cells Most people with a unilateral acoustic neuroma are not affected with NF Some people with NF howeveronly develop a tumor in one of the vestibulocochlearnerves Others may initially be diagnosed with a unilateral tumor but may develop a tumor in the other nerve anumber of years later NF should be considered in someone under the age of who has a unilateral acoustic neuroma Someone with a unilateral acoustic neuroma andother family members diagnosed with NF probably isaffected with NF Someone with a unilateral acousticneuroma and other symptoms of NF such as cataractsand other tumors may also be affected with NF On theother hand someone over the age of with a unilateralacoustic neuroma no other tumors and no family historyof NF is very unlikely to be affected with NF Symptoms Small acoustic neuromas usually only interfere with the functioning of the vestibulocochlear nerve The mostcommon first symptom of an acoustic neuroma is hearingloss which is often accompanied by a ringing sound tinnitis People with acoustic neuromas sometimes reportdifficulties in using the phone and difficulties in perceivingthe tone of a musical instrument or sound even when theirhearing appears to be otherwise normal In most cases thehearing loss is initially subtle and worsens gradually overtime until deafness occurs in the affected ear In approximately of cases the hearing loss is sudden and severe Acoustic neuromas can also affect the functioning of the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve andvan cause vertigo and dysequilibrium Twenty percent ofsmall tumors are associated with periodic vertigo whichis characterized by dizziness or a whirling sensation Larger acoustic neuromas are less likely to cause vertigobut more likely to cause dysequilibrium Dysequilibriumwhich is characterized by minor clumsiness and a general feeling of instability occurs in nearly of peoplewith an acoustic neuroma As the tumor grows larger it can press on the surround ing cranial nerves Compression of the fifth cranial nervecan result in facial pain and or numbness Compression of the seventh cranial nerve can cause spasms weakness or GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Acoustic neuromaGEM to A PM Page paralysis of the facial muscles Double vision is a rare symptom but can result when the th cranial nerve is affected Swallowing andor speaking difficulties can occur if thetumor presses against the th th or th cranial nerves If left untreated the tumor can become large enough to press against and affect the functioning of the brainstem The brain stem is the stalk like portion of the brainthat joins the spinal cord to the cerebrum the thinking andreasoning part of the brain Different parts of the brainstem have different functions such as the control of breathing and muscle coordination Large tumors that impact thebrain stem can result in headaches walking difficultiesgait ataxia and involuntary shaking movements of themuscles tremors In rare cases when an acoustic neuro ma remains undiagnosed and untreated it can cause nausea vomiting lethargy and eventually coma respiratory difficulties and death In the vast majority of cases how ever the tumor is discovered and treated long before it islarge enough to cause such serious manifestations Diagnosis Anyone with symptoms of hearing loss should under go hearing evaluations

harmless electrical impulse ispassed from the inner ear to the brainstem An acousticneuroma can interfere with the passage of this electrical impulse and this interference can sometimes beidentified through the ABR evaluation A normal ABRexamination does not rule out the possibility of anacoustic neuroma An abnormal ABR examinationincreases the likelihood that an acoustic neuroma ispresent but other tests are necessary to confirm thepresence of a tumor If an acoustic neuroma is strongly suspected then magnetic resonance imaging MRI is usually per formed The MRI is a very accurate evaluation that is GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Acoustic neuromaGEM to A PM Page able to detect nearly of acoustic neuromas Com puterized tomography CT scan CAT scanis unable toidentify smaller tumors but it can be used when anacoustic neuroma is suspected and an MRI evaluationcannot be performed Once an acoustic neuroma is diagnosed an evalua tion by genetic specialists such as a geneticist and genetic counselor may be recommended The purpose of thisevaluation is to obtain a detailed family history andcheck for signs of NF If NF is strongly suspectedthen DNA testing may be recommended DNA testinginvolves checking the blood cells obtained from a routine blood draw for the common gene changes associated with NF Treatment The three treatment options for acoustic neuroma are surgery radiation and observation The physicianand patient should discuss the pros and cons of the different options prior to making a decision about treatmentThe patients physical health age symptoms tumorsize and tumor location should be considered Microsurgery The surgical removal of the tumor or tumors is the most common treatment for acoustic neuroma In mostcases the entire tumor is removed during the surgery Ifthe tumor is large and causing significant symptoms yetthere is a need to preserve hearing in that ear then onlypart of the tumor may be removed During the procedurethe tumor is removed under microscopic guidance andgeneral anesthetic Monitoring of the neighboring cranialnerves is done during the procedure so that damage tothese nerves can be prevented If preservation of hearingis a possibility then monitoring of hearing will also takeplace during the surgery Most people stay in the hospital four to seven days following the surgery Total recovery usually takes fourto six weeks Most people experience fatigue and head discomfort following the surgery Problems with balanceand head and neck stiffness are also common The mortality rate of this type of surgery is less than at mostmajor centers Approximately of patients experience some degree of postsurgical complications In mostcases these complications can be managed successfullyand do not result in long term medical problems Surgerybrings with it a risk of stroke damage to the brain stem infection leakage of spinal fluid and damage to the cranial nerves Hearing loss andor tinnitis often result fromthe surgery A followup MRI is recommended one tofive years following the surgery because of possibleregrowth of the tumorStereotactic Radiation therapy During stereotactic radiation therapy also called radiosurgery or radiotherapy many small beams of radiation are aimed directly at the acoustic neuroma The radiation is administered in a single large dose under localanesthetic and is performed on an outpatient basis Thisresults in a high dose of radiation to the tumor but littleradiation exposure to the surrounding area This treatment approach is limited to small or medium tumorsThe goal of the surgery is to cause tumor shrinkage or atleast limit the growth of the tumor The long term efficacy and risks of this treatment approach are not knownPeriodic MRI monitoring throughout the life of thepatient is therefore recommended Radiation therapy can cause hearing loss which can sometimes occurs even years later Radiation therapy canalso cause damage to neighboring cranial nerves whichcan result in symptoms such as numbness pain or paralysisof the facial muscles In many cases these symptoms aretemporary Radiation treatment can also induce the formation of other benign or malignant schwannomas This typeof treatment may therefore be contraindicated in the treatment of acoustic neuromas in those with NF who are predisposed to developing schwannomas and other tumors Observation Acoustic neuromas are usually slow growing and in some cases they will stop growing and even becomesmaller or disappear entirely It may therefore be appropriate in some cases to hold off on treatment and to periodically monitor the tumor through MRI evaluationsLongterm observation may be appropriate for examplein an elderly person with a small acoustic neuroma andfew symptoms Periodic observation may also be indicated for someone with a small and asymptomatic acousticneuroma that was detected through an evaluation foranother medical problem Observation may also be suggested for someone with an acoustic neuroma in the onlyhearing ear or in the ear that has better hearing The danger of an observational approach is that as the tumorgrows larger it can become more difficult to treat Prognosis The prognosis for someone with a unilateral acoustic neuroma is usually quite good provided the tumor is diagnosed early and appropriate treatment is instituted Longterm hearing loss and tinnitis in the affected ear are common even if appropriate treatment is provided Regrowth ofthe tumor is also a possibility following surgery or radiationtherapy and repeat treatment may be necessary The prognosis can be poorer for those with NF who have an increasedrisk of bilateral acoustic neuromas and other tumors GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Acoustic neuromaGEM to A PM Page Resources BOOKS

calledgigantism with the additional bone growth causingunusual height When the abnormality occurs after bonegrowth stops the disorder is called acromegaly Description Acromegaly is a relatively rare disorder occurring in approximately out of every one million people Both men and women are affected Becausethe symptoms of acromegaly occur so gradually diagnosis is often delayed The majority of patients are notidentified until they are middle aged Causes and symptoms The pituitary is a small gland located at the base of the brain A gland is a collection of cells that releasescertain chemicals or hormones which are important tothe functioning of other organs or body systems Thepituitary hormones travel throughout the body and areinvolved in a large number of activities including theregulation of growth and reproductive functions Thecause of acromegaly can be traced to the pituitarys production of GH Under normal conditions the pituitary receives input from another brain structure the hypothalamus locatedat the base of the brain This input from the hypothalamus regulates the pituitarys release of hormones Forexample the hypothalamus produces growth hormonereleasing hormone GHRH which directs the pituitaryto release GH Input from the hypothalamus should alsodirect the pituitary to stop releasing hormones In acromegaly the pituitary continues to release GH and ignores signals from the hypothalamus In the liverGH causes production of a hormone called insulinlikegrowth factor IGF which is responsible for growththroughout the body When the pituitary refuses to stopproducing GH the levels of IGF also reach abnormalpeaks Bones soft tissue and organs throughout the bodybegin to enlarge and the body changes its ability toprocess and use nutrients like sugars and fats In acromegaly an individuals hands and feet begin to grow becoming thick and doughy The jaw line noseand forehead also grow and facial features are describedas coarsening The tongue grows larger and becausethe jaw is larger the teeth become more widely spacedDue to swelling within the structures of the throat andsinuses the voice becomes deeper and sounds more hollow and patients may develop loud snoring Various hor monal changes cause symptoms such as GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Acromegaly and gigantismGEM to A PM Page heavy sweating oily skin increased coarse body hair improper processing of sugars in the diet and some times actual diabetes high blood pressure increased calcium in the urine sometimes leading to kidney stones increased risk of gallstones and swelling of the thyroid gland People with acromegaly have more skin tags or out growths of tissue than normal This increase in skin tagsis also associated with the development of growthscalled polyps within the large intestine that may eventually become cancerous Patients with acromegaly oftensuffer from headaches and arthritis The variousswellings and enlargements throughout the body maypress on nerves causing sensations of local tingling orburning and sometimes result in muscle weakness The most common cause of this disorder in of patients is the development of a noncancerous tumor within the pituitary called a pituitary adenoma These tumorsare the source of the abnormal release of GH As thesetumors grow they may press on nearby structures within thebrain causing headaches and changes in vision As the adenoma grows it may disrupt other pituitary tissue interferingwith the release of other hormones These disruptions maybe responsible for changes in the menstrual cycle ofwomen decreases in the sexual drive in men and womenand the abnormal production of breast milk in women Inrare cases acromegaly is caused by the abnormal production of GHRH which leads to the increased production ofGH Certain tumors in the pancreas lungs adrenal glandsthyroid and intestine produce GHRH which in turn triggersproduction of an abnormal quantity of GH Diagnosis Because acromegaly produces slow changes over time diagnosis is often significantly delayed In fact thecharacteristic coarsening of the facial features is oftennot recognized by family members friends or longtimefamily physicians Often the diagnosis is suspected by anew physician who sees the patient for the first time andis struck by the patients characteristic facial appearanceComparing old photographs from a number of differenttime periods will often increase suspicion of the disease Because the quantity of GH produced varies widely under normal conditions demonstrating high levels ofGH in the blood is not sufficient to merit a diagnosis ofacromegaly Instead laboratory tests measuring anincrease of IGF times above the normal level are useful These results however must be carefully interpreted because normal laboratory values for IGF varywhen the patient is pregnant undergoing puberty elder ly or severely malnourished Normal patients will show adecrease in GH production when given a large dose ofsugar glucose Patients with acromegaly will not showthis decrease and will often show an increase in GH production Magnetic resonance imaging MRI is useful for viewing the pituitary and for identifying and locatingan adenoma When no adenoma can be located the searchfor a GHRHproducing tumor in another location begins Treatment The first step in treatment of acromegaly is removal of all

Areas of scar tissue blisters boils rashes or varicose veins should be avoided Finally certain acu pressure points should not be stimulated on people withhigh or low blood pressure and on pregnant women Research and general acceptance In general Chinese medicine has been slow to gain acceptance in the West mainly because it rests on ideasvery foreign to the scientific model For instance Western scientists have trouble with the idea of chi the invisible energy of the body and the idea that pressing on certain points can alleviate certain conditions seems sometimes too simple for scientists to believe Western scientists in trying to account for the action of acupressure have theorized that chi is actually part ofthe neuroendocrine system of the body Celebrated orthopedic surgeon Robert O Becker who was twice nominatedfor the Nobel Prize wrote a book on the subject calledCross Currents The Promise of Electromedicine The Perils of Electropollution By using precise electrical measur ing devices Becker and his colleagues showed that thebody has a complex web of electromagnetic energy andthat traditional acupressure meridians and points containedamounts of energy that nonacupressure

and balanceinternal organs In France where acupuncture is very popular and more accepted by the medical establishment neurologist Paul Nogier developed a system of acupuncturebased on neuroendocrine theory rather than on traditionalChinese concepts which is gaining some use in America Basic ideas of Chinese medicine Chinese medicine views the body as a small part of the universe and subject to universal laws and principlesof harmony and balance Chinese medicine does notdraw a sharp line as Western medicine does betweenmind and body The Chinese system believes that emotions and mental states are every bit as influential on disease as purely physical mechanisms and considers factors like work environment lifestyle and relationships as fundamental to the overall picture of a patients healthChinese medicine also uses very different symbols andideas to discuss the body and health While Western medicine typically describes health in terms of measurablephysical processes made up of chemical reactions theChinese use ideas like yin and yang chi the organ system and the five elements to describe health and thebody To understand the ideas behind acupuncture it isworthwhile to introduce some of these basic terms YIN AND YANG According to Chinese philosophy the universe and the body can be described by two separate but complementary principles that of yin and yangFor example in temperature yin is cold and yang is hotIn gender yin is female and yang is male In activity yinis passive and yang is active In light yin is dark andyang is bright in direction yin is inward and downwardand yang is outward and up and so on Nothing is evercompletely yin or yang but a combination of the twoThese two principles are always interacting opposingand influencing each other The goal of Chinese medicine is not to eliminate either yin or yang but to allowthe two to balance each other and exist harmoniouslytogether For instance if a person suffers from symptoms GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Acupuncture Conception vessel Stomach meridian Large intestine meridian Gallbladder meridianGovernor vessel Bladder meridian Triple burner meridian Small intestine meridian Acupuncture sites and meridians on the face and neck Illustration by Hans CassadyGEM to A PM Page of high blood pressure the Chinese system would say that the heart organ might have too much yang andwould recommend methods either to reduce the yang orto increase the yin of the heart depending on the othersymptoms and organs in the body Thus acupuncturetherapies seek to either increase or reduce yang orincrease or reduce yin in particular regions of the body CHI Another fundamental concept of Chinese med icine is that of chi pronounced chee also spelled qi Chi is the fundamental life energy of the universe It is invisible and is found in the environment in the air water foodand sunlight In the body it is the invisible vital forcethat creates and animates life We are all born with inherited amounts of chi and we also get acquired chi fromthe food we eat and the air we breathe The level andquality of a persons chi also depends on the state ofphysical mental and emotional balance Chi travelsthrough the body along channels called meridians THE ORGAN SYSTEM In the Chinese system there are twelve main organs the lung large intestine stomach spleen heart small intestine urinary bladder kidney liver gallbladder pericardium and the triplewarmer which represents the entire torso region Eachorgan has chi energy associated with it and each organinteracts with particular emotions on the mental level Asthere are twelve organs there are twelve types of chiwhich can move through the body and these movethrough twelve main channels or meridians Chinesedoctors connect symptoms to organs That is

Tonification Acupuncture technique for strength ening the body YinYang Universal characteristics used to des cribe aspects of the natural worldorgan to another Each organ has a different profile of symptoms it can manifest THE FIVE ELEMENTS Another basis of Chinese theo ry is that the world and body are made up of five mainelements wood fire earth metal and water These elements are all interconnected and each element eithergenerates or controls another element For instancewater controls fire and earth generates metal Each organis associated with one of the five elements The Chinesesystem uses elements and organs to describe and treatconditions For instance the kidney is associated withwater and the heart is associated with fire and the twoorgans are related as water and fire are related If the kidney is weak then there might be a corresponding fireproblem in the heart so treatment might be made byacupuncture or herbs to cool the heart system andorincrease energy in the kidney system The Chinese have developed an intricate system of how organs and elements are related to physical andmental symptoms and the above example is a very simple one Although this system sounds suspect to Westernscientists some interesting parallels have been observedFor instance Western medicine has observed that withsevere heart problems kidney failure often follows but itstill does not know exactly why In Chinese medicinethis connection between the two organs has long beenestablished MEDICAL PROBLEMS AND ACUPUNCTURE In Chi nese medicine disease as seen as imbalances in the organsystem or chi meridians and the goal of any remedy ortreatment is to assist the body in reestablishing its innateharmony Disease can be caused by internal factors likeemotions external factors like the environment andweather and other factors like injuries trauma diet andgerms However infection is seen not as primarily aproblem with germs and viruses but as a weakness in theenergy of the body which is allowing a sickness to occurIn Chinese medicine no two illnesses are ever the sameas each body has its own characteristics of symptoms andbalance Acupuncture is used to open or adjust the flowof chi throughout the organ system which will strengthen the body and prompt it to heal itself A VISIT TO THE ACUPUNCTURIST The first thing an acupuncturist will do is get a thorough idea of a patientsmedical history and symptoms both physical and emotional This is done with a long questionnaire and interview Then the acupuncturist will examine the patient tofind further symptoms looking closely at the tongue thepulse at various points in the body the complexion general behavior and other signs like coughs or pains Fromthis the practitioner will be able to determine patterns ofsymptoms which indicate which organs and areas are GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AcupunctureGEM to A PM Page imbalanced Depending on the problem the acupunctur ist will insert needles to manipulate chi on one or moreof the twelve organ meridians On these twelve meridians there are nearly points which can be used inacupuncture with around points being most frequently used by traditional acupuncturists During anindividual treatment one to twenty needles may be useddepending on which meridian points are chosen Acupuncture needles are always sterilized and acupuncture is a very safe procedure The depth of insertion of needles varies depending on which chi channels arebeing treated Some points barely go beyond superficiallayers of skin while some acupuncture points require adepth of in cm of needle The needles generally do not cause pain Patients sometimes report pinchingsensations and often pleasant sensations as the body experiences healing Depending on the problem the acupuncturist might spin or move the needles or even pass a slightelectrical current through some of them Moxibustion may be sometimes used in which an herbal mixture moxa ormugwort is either burned like incense on the acupuncturepoint or on the end of the needle which is believed to stimulate chi in a particular way Also acupuncturists sometimes use cupping during which small suction cups are placed on meridian points to stimulate them How long the needles are inserted also varies Some patients only require a quick in and out insertion to clearproblems and provide tonification strengthening of health while some other conditions might require needles inserted up to an hour or more The average visit toan acupuncturist takes about thirty minutes The numberof visits to the acupuncturist varies as well with someconditions improved in one or two sessions and othersrequiring a series of six or more visits over the course ofweeks or months Costs for acupuncture can vary depending on whether the practitioner is an MD Initial visits with nonMDacupuncturists can run from with followup visits usually costing less Insurance reimbursement alsovaries widely depending on the company and state Regulations have been changing often Some states authorizeMedicaid to cover acupuncture for certain conditions andsome states have mandated that general coverage pay foracupuncture Consumers should be aware of the provisionsfor acupuncture in their individual policies Precautions Acupuncture is generally a very safe procedure If a patient is in doubt about a medical condition more thanone physician should be consulted Also a patient shouldalways feel comfortable and confident that theiracupuncturist is knowledgable and properly trainedResearch and general acceptance Mainstream medicine has been slow to accept acupunc ture although more MDs are using it the American MedicalAssociation does not recognize it as a specialty The reasonfor this is that the mechanism of acupuncture is difficult toscientifically understand or measure such as the invisibleenergy of chi in the body Western medicine admitting thatacupuncture works in many cases has theorized that theenergy meridians are actually part of the nervous system andthat acupuncture relieves pain by releasing endorphins ornatural pain killers into the bloodstream Despite the ambiguity in the

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Acute kidney failureGEM to A PM Page cannot adequately remove fluids and wastes from the body or maintain the proper level of certain kidneyregulated chemicals in the bloodstream Description The kidneys are the bodys natural filtration system They perform the critical task of processing approximately quarts of fluid in the bloodstream every hoursWaste products like urea and toxins along with excessfluids are removed from the bloodstream in the form ofurine Kidney or renal failure occurs when kidney functioning becomes impaired Fluids and toxins begin toaccumulate in the bloodstream As fluids build up in thebloodstream the patient with acute kidney failure maybecome puffy and swollen edematous in the face handsand feet Their blood pressure typically begins to rise andthey may experience fatigue and nausea Unlike chronic kidney failure which is long term and irreversible acute kidney failure is a temporary condition With proper and timely treatment it can typicallybe reversed Often there is no permanent damage to thekidneys Acute kidney failure appears most frequently asa complication of serious illness like heart failure l i v e r failure dehydration severe burns and excessive bleed ing hemorrhage It may also be caused by an obstruction to the urinary tract or as a direct result of kidney disease injury or an adverse reaction to a medicine Causes and symptoms Acute kidney failure can be caused by many differ ent illnesses injuries and infections These conditionsfall into three main categories prerenal postrenal and intrarenal conditions Prerenal conditions do not damage the kidney but can cause diminished kidney function They are the mostcommon cause of acute renal failure and include dehydration hemorrhage septicemia or sepsis heart failure liver failure burns Postrenal conditions cause kidney failure by obstruct ing the urinary tract These conditions include inflammation of the prostate gland in men prostatitis enlargement of the prostate gland benign prostatic hypertrophy bladder or pelvic tumors kidney stones calculiIntrarenal conditions involve kidney disease or direct injury to the kidneys These conditions include lack of blood supply to the kidneys ischemia use of radiocontrast agents in patients with kidney problems drug abuse or overdose longterm use of nephrotoxic medications like certain pain medicines acute inflammation of the glomeruli or filters of the kidney glomerulonephritis kidney infections pyelitis or pyelonephritis Common symptoms of acute kidney failure include anemia The kidneys are responsible for producing ery thropoietin EPO a hormone that stimulates red bloodcell production If kidney disease causes shrinking ofthe kidney red blood cell production is reduced leading to anemia bad breath or bad taste in mouth Urea in the saliva may cause an ammonialike taste in the mouth bone and joint problems The kidneys produce vitamin D which helps the body absorb calcium and keepsbones strong For patients with kidney failure bonesmay become brittle In children normal growth may bestunted Joint pain may also occur as a result of highphosphate levels in the blood Retention of uric acidmay cause gout edema Puffiness or swelling in the arms hands feet and around the eyes frequent urination foamy or bloody urine Protein in the urine may cause it to foam significantly Blood in the urine may indicatebleeding from diseased or obstructed kidneys bladderor ureters headaches High blood pressure may trigger headaches hypertension or high blood pressure The retention of fluids and wastes causes blood volume to increase Thismakes blood pressure rise increased fatigue Toxic substances in the blood and the presence of anemia may cause the patient to feelexhausted itching Phosphorus normally eliminated in the urine accumulates in the blood of patients with kidney failureAn increased phosphorus level may cause the skin to itch lower back pain

juices may cause upset stomach GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Acute kidney failureGEM to A PM Page Diagnosis Kidney failure is diagnosed by a doctor A nephrolo gist a doctor that specializes in the kidney may be consulted to confirm the diagnosis and recommend treatment options The patient that is suspected of havingacute kidney failure will have blood and urine tests todetermine the level of kidney function A blood test willassess the levels of creatinine blood urea nitrogenBUN uric acid phosphate sodium and potassiumThe kidney regulates these agents in the blood Urinesamples will also be collected usually over a hourperiod to assess protein loss andor creatinine clearance Determining the cause of kidney failure is critical to proper treatment A full assessment of the kidneys is necessary to determine if the underlying disease is treatable and ifthe kidney failure is chronic or acute X rays magnetic res onance imaging MRI computed tomography scan CT ultrasound renal biopsy andor arteriogram of the kidneysmay be used to determine the cause of kidney failure andlevel of remaining kidney function X rays and ultrasoundof the bladder andor ureters may also be needed Treatment Treatment for acute kidney failure varies Treatment is directed to the underlying primary medical conditionthat has triggered kidney failure Prerenal conditions maybe treated with replacement fluids given through a veindiuretics blood transfusion or medications Postrenal conditions and intrarenal conditions may require surgeryandor medication Frequently patients in acute kidney failure require hemodialysis hemofiltration or peritoneal dialysis to fil ter fluids and wastes from the bloodstream until the primary medical condition can be controlled Hemodialysis Hemodialysis involves circulating the patients blood outside of the body through an extracorporeal circuit ECC or dialysis circuit The ECC is made up ofplastic blood tubing a filter known as a dialyzer or artificial kidney and a dialysis machine that monitors andmaintains blood flow and administers dialysateDialysate is a sterile chemical solution that is used todraw waste products out of the blood The patients bloodleaves the body through the vein and travels through theECC and the dialyzer where fluid removal takes place During dialysis waste products in the bloodstream are carried out of the body At the same time electrolytesand other chemicals are added to the blood The purifiedchemicallybalanced blood is then returned to the bodyKEY TERMS Blood urea nitrogen BUN A waste product that is formed in the liver and collects in the bloodstream patients with kidney failure have highBUN levels Creatinine A protein produced by muscle that healthy kidneys filter out Extracorporeal Outside of or unrelated to the body Ischemia A lack of blood supply to an organ or tissue Nephrotoxic Toxic or damaging to the kidney Radiocontrast agents Dyes administered to a patient for the purposes of a radiologic study Sepsis A bacterial infection of the bloodstream Vasopressors Medications that constrict the blood vessels A dialysis run typically lasts three to four hours depending on the type of dialyzer used and the physicalcondition of the patient Dialysis is used several times aweek until acute kidney failure is reversed Blood pressure changes associated with hemodialy sis may pose a risk for patients with heart problems Peritoneal dialysis may be the preferred treatment option inthese cases Hemofiltration Hemofiltration also called continuous renal replace ment therapy CRRT is a slow continuous blood filtration therapy used to control acute kidney failure in critically ill patients These patients are typically very sickand may have heart problems or circulatory problemsThey cannot handle the rapid filtration rates of hemodialysis They also frequently need antibiotics nutrition vasopressors and other fluids given through a vein totreat their primary condition Because hemofiltration iscontinuous prescription fluids can be given to patients inkidney failure without the risk of fluid overload Like hemodialysis hemofiltration uses an ECC A hollow fiber hemofilter is used instead of a dialyzer toremove fluids and toxins Instead of a dialysis machine ablood pump makes the blood flow through the ECC Thevolume of blood circulating through the ECC in hemofiltration is less than that in hemodialysis Filtration ratesare slower and gentler on the circulatory system GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Acute kidney failureGEM to A PM Page Hemofiltration treatment will generally be used until kid ney failure is reversed Peritoneal dialysis Peritoneal dialysis may be used if an acute kidney failure patient is stable and not in immediate crisis Inperitoneal dialysis PD the lining of the patientsabdomen the peritoneum acts as a blood filter A flexibletubelike instrument catheter is surgically inserted intothe patients abdomen During treatment the catheter isused to fill the abdominal cavity with dialysate Wasteproducts and excess fluids move from the patients bloodstream into the dialysate solution After a certain timeperiod the wastefilled dialysate is drained from theabdomen and replaced with clean dialysate There arethree type of peritoneal dialysis which vary according totreatment time and administration method Peritoneal dialysis is often the best treatment option for infants and children Their small size can make veinaccess difficult to maintain It is not recommended forpatients with abdominal adhesions or other abdominaldefects like a hernia that might reduce the efficiency of the treatment It is also not recommended for patientswho suffer frequent bouts of an inflammation of thesmall pouches in the intestinal tract diverticulitis Prognosis Because many of the illnesses and underlying con ditions that often trigger acute kidney failure are criticalthe prognosis for these patients many times is not goodStudies have estimated overall death rates for acute kid ney failure at Many people however diebecause of the primary disease that has caused the kidney failure These figures may also be misleadingbecause patients who experience kidney failure as aresult of less serious illnesses like kidney stones ordehydration have an excellent chance of completerecovery Early recognition and prompt appropriatetreatment are key to patient recovery Up to of patients who experience acute kidney failure will suffer irreversible kidney damage They willeventually go on to develop chronic kidney failure orendstage renal disease These patients will require longterm dialysis or kidney transplantation to replace their lost renal functioning Prevention Since acute kidney failure can be caused by many things prevention is difficult Medications that mayimpair kidney function should be given cautiouslyPatients with preexisting kidney conditions who arehospitalized for other illnesses or injuries should be care fully monitored for kidney failure complications Treatments and procedures that may put them at risk for kidney failure like diagnostic tests requiring radiocontrastagents or dyes should be used with

lymphangitis Definition Acute lymphangitis is a bacterial infection in the lymphatic vessels which is characterized by painful redstreaks below the skin surface This is a potentially serious infection which can rapidly spread to the bloodstream and be fatal Description Acute lymphangitis affects a critical member of the immune systemthe lymphatic system Waste materialsfrom nearly every organ in the body drain into the lymphatic vessels and are filtered in small organs calledlymph nodes Foreign bodies such as bacteria or virusesare processed in the lymph nodes to generate an immuneresponse to fight an infection GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Acute lymphangitisGEM to A PM Page In acute lymphangitis bacteria enter the body through a cut scratch insect bite surgical wound orother skin injury Once the bacteria enter the lymphaticsystem they multiply rapidly and follow the lymphaticvessel like a highway The infected lymphatic vesselbecomes inflamed causing red streaks that are visiblebelow the skin surface The growth of the bacteria occursso rapidly that the immune system does not respond fastenough to stop the infection If left untreated the bacteria can cause tissue destruction in the area of the infection A pusfilledpainful lump called an abscess may be formed in the infected area Cellulitis a generalized infection of the lower skin layers may also occur In addition the bacteria may invade the bloodstream and cause septicemiaLay people for that reason often call the red streaks seenin the skin blood poisoning Septicemia is a very serious illness and may be fatal Causes and symptoms Acute lymphangitis is most often caused by the bac terium Streptococcus pyogenes This potentially danger ous bacterium also causes strep throat infections of the heart spinal cord and lungs and in the s has beencalled the flesheating bacterium Staphylococci bacteria may also cause lymphangitis Although anyone can develop lymphangitis some people are more at risk People who have had radical mas tectomy removal of a breast and nearby lymph nodes a leg vein removed for coronary bypass surgery or recurrentlymphangitis caused by tinea pedis a fungal infection onthe foot are at an increased risk for lymphangitis The characteristic symptoms of acute lymphangitis are the wide red streaks which travel from the site ofinfection to the armpit or groin The affected areas are redswollen and painful Blistering of the affected skin mayoccur The bacterial infection causes a fever of F C In addition a general ill feeling muscleaches headache chills and loss of appetite may be felt Diagnosis If lymphangitis is suspected the person should call his or her doctor immediately or go to an emergencyroom Acute lymphangitis could be diagnosed by thefamily doctor infectious disease specialist or an emergency room doctor The painful red streaks just belowthe skin surface and the high fever are diagnostic of acutelymphangitis A sample of blood would be taken for culture to determine whether the bacteria have entered thebloodstream A biopsy removal of a piece of infectedtissue sample may be taken for culture to identify whichKEY TERMS Biopsy The process which removes a sample of diseased or infected tissue for microscopic examination to aid in diagnosis Lymphatic system A component of the immune system consisting of vessels and nodes Wastematerials from organs drain into the lymphaticvessels and are filtered by the lymph nodes Septicemia Disease caused by the presence and growth of bacteria in the bloodstream type of bacteria is causing the infection Diagnosis is immediate because it is based primarily on the symptoms Most insurance policies should cover the expensesfor the diagnosis and treatment of acute lymphangitis Treatment Because of the serious nature of this infection treat ment would begin immediately even before the bacterialculture results were available The only treatment foracute lymphangitis is to give very large doses of anantibiotic usually penicillin through the vein Growingstreptococcal bacteria are usually eliminated rapidly andeasily by penicillin The antibiotic clindamycin may beincluded in the treatment to kill any streptococci whichare not growing and are in a resting state Alternatively abroad spectrum antibiotic may be used which wouldkill many different kinds of bacteria Aspirin or other medications which reduce the pain and the fever may also be given Medications whichreduce any inflammation of the infected region may alsobe provided The patient is likely to be hospitalized toadminister the antibiotic and other medications and toclosely monitor his or her condition Surgical drainage ofan abscess may be necessary Prognosis Complete recovery is expected if antibiotic treatment is begun at an early stage of the infection However ifuntreated acute lymphangitis can be a very serious andeven deadly disease Acute lymphangitis that goes untreated can spread causing tissue damage Extensive

traumain which the mind tries to cope by sealing off somefeatures of the trauma from conscious awareness Description Acute stress disorder is a new diagnostic category that was introduced in to differentiate timelimitedreactions to trauma from posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD Causes and symptoms Acute stress disorder is caused by exposure to trau ma which is defined as a stressor that causes intense fearand usually involves threats to life or serious injury tooneself or others Examples are rape mugging combatnatural disasters etc The symptoms of stress disorder include a combining of one or more dissociative and anxiety symptoms withthe avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event Dissociative symptoms include emotional detachment temporary loss of memory depersonalization and derealization Anxiety symptoms connected with acute stress disor der include irritability physical restlessness sleep problems inability to concentrate and being easily startled Diagnosis Diagnosis of acute stress disorder is based on a com bination of the patients history and a physical examina tion to rule out diseases that can cause anxiety TheKEY TERMS Depersonalization A dissociative symptom in which the patient feels that his or her body is unreal is changing or is dissolving Derealization A dissociative symptom in which the external environment is perceived as unreal Dissociation A

hasbeen partially replaced by the word dependence for sub stance abuse Addiction has been extended however toinclude moodaltering behaviors or activities Someresearchers speak of two types of addictions substanceaddictions for example alcoholism drug abuse and smoking and process addictions for example gam bling spending shopping eating and sexual activityThere is a growing recognition that many addicts such aspolydrug abusers are addicted to more than one substance or process Description Addiction is one of the most costly public health problems in the United States It is a progressive syndrome which means that it increases in severity overtime unless it is treated Substance abuse is characterizedby frequent relapse or return to the abused substanceSubstance abusers often make repeated attempts to quitbefore they are successful In the economic cost of substance abuse in the United States exceeded billion with health carecosts attributed to substance abuse estimated at morethan billion By eighth grade of adolescents have consumed alcohol have smoked tobacco and havesmoked marijuana Compared to females males arealmost four times as likely to be heavy drinkers nearlyone and a half more likely to smoke a pack or more ofcigarettes daily and twice as likely to smoke marijuanaweekly However among adolescents these gender differences are decreasing Although frequent use of tobaccococaine and heavy drinking appears to have remained stable in the s marijuana use increased In an estimated four million Americans over the age of used prescription pain relievers sedatives and stimulants for nonmedical reasons during one month In the United States of the population regularly uses tobacco Tobacco use reportedly kills times asmany people each year as alcohol and drug abuse combined According to data from the World HealthOrganization there were billion smokers worldwideand tobaccorelated deaths per day Furthermorein the United States of children

attitudes towardeating and eating behaviors More than women dieeach year from anorexia nervosa GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AddictionGEM to A PM Page A Harvard study found that an estimated million Americans suffered from a gambling addictionOver half that number million were adolescents Causes and symptoms Addiction to substances results from the interaction of several factors Drug chemistry Some substances are more addictive than others either because they produce a rapid and intense change inmood or because they produce painful withdrawalsymptoms when stopped suddenly Genetic factor Some people appear to be more vulnerable to addic tion because their body chemistry increases their sensitivity to drugs Some forms of substance abuse and dependence seem to run in families and this may be the result of a genetic predisposition environmental influences or a combination of both Brain structure and function Using drugs repeatedly over time changes brain structure and function in fundamental and longlastingways Addiction comes about through an array ofchanges in the brain and the strengthening of new memory connections Evidence suggests that those longlastingbrain changes are responsible for the distortions of cognitive and emotional functioning that characterizeaddicts particularly the compulsion to use drugsAlthough the causes of addiction remain the subject ofongoing debate and research many experts now consideraddiction to be a brain disease a condition caused bypersistent changes in brain structure and function However having this brain disease does not absolve theaddict of responsibility for his or her behavior but it doesexplain why many addicts cannot stop using drugs bysheer force of will alone Social learning Social learning is considered the most important sin gle factor It includes patterns of use in the addicts family or subculture peer pressure and advertising or mediainfluence Availability Inexpensive or readily available tobacco alcohol or drugs produce marked increases in rates of addictionIndividual development Before the s the socalled addictive personality was used to explain the development of addiction Theaddictive personality was described as escapist impulsive dependent devious manipulative and selfcentered Many doctors now believe that these charactertraits develop in addicts as a result of the addictionrather than the traits being a cause of the addiction Diagnosis In addition to a preoccupation with using and acquiring the abused substance the diagnosis of addiction is based on five criteria loss of willpower

previously achieved with a lower dose Withdrawal The unpleasant sometimes life threatening physiological changes that occur dueto the discontinuation of use of some drugs afterprolonged regular useTreatment Treatment requires both medical and social approaches Substance addicts may need hospital treatment to manage withdrawal symptoms Individual orgroup psychotherapy is often helpful but only after substance use has stopped Antiaddiction medications suchas methadone and naltrexone are also commonly used The most frequently recommended social form of outpatient treatment is the twelvestep program Suchprograms are also frequently combined with psychotherapy According to a recent study reported by the American Psychological Association APA anyone regardlessof his or her religious beliefs or lack of religious beliefscan benefit from participation in step programs suchas Alcoholics Anonymous AA or Narcotics Anonymous NA The number of visits to step selfhelpgroups exceeds the number of visits to all mental healthprofessionals combined There are twelvestep groupsfor all major substance and process addictions The Twelve Steps are Admit powerlessness over the addiction Believe that a Power greater than oneself could restore sanity Make a decision to turn your will and your life over to the care of God as you understand him Make a searching and fearless moral inventory of self Admit to God yourself and another human being the exact nature of your wrongs Become willing to have God remove all these defects from your character Humbly ask God to remove shortcomings Make a list of all persons harmed by your wrongs and become willing to make amends to them all Make direct amends to such people whenever possible except when to do so would injure them or others Continue to take personal inventory and promptly admit any future wrongdoings Seek to improve contact with a God of the individuals understanding through meditation and prayer Carry the message of spiritual awakening to others and practice these principles in all your affairs Alternative treatment Acupuncture and homeopathy have been used to treat withdrawal symptoms Meditation yoga and reiki healing have been recommended for process addictionshowever the success of these programs has not been welldocumented through controlled studiesPrognosis The prognosis for recovery from any addiction depends on the substance or process the individuals circumstances and underlying personality structure Polydrug users have the worst prognosis for recovery Prevention The most effective form of prevention appears to be a stable family that models responsible attitudes towardmoodaltering substances and behaviors Prevention education programs are also widely used to inform the public of the

This results in decreased production of twoimportant chemicals hormones normally released bythe adrenal cortex cortisol and aldosterone Description The adrenals are two glands each perched on the upper part of the two kidneys The outer part of the glandis known as the cortex the inner part is known as themedulla Each of these parts of the adrenal gland isresponsible for producing different types of hormones Cortisol is a very potent hormone produced by the adrenal cortex It is involved in regulating the functioningof nearly every type of organ and tissue throughout thebody and is considered to be one of the few hormonesabsolutely necessary for life Cortisol is involved in the very complex processing and utilization of many nutri ents including sugars carbohydrates fats and proteins the normal functioning of the circulatory system and the heartKEY TERMS Gland A collection of cells whose function is to release certain chemicals or hormones which areimportant to the functioning of other sometimesdistantly located organs or body systems Hormone A chemical produced in one part of the body which travels to another part of the bodyin order to exert its effect the functioning of muscles normal kidney function production of blood cells the normal processes involved in maintaining the skele tal system proper functioning of the brain and nerves the normal responses of the immune system Aldosterone also produced by the adrenal cortex plays a central role in maintaining the appropriate proportions of water and salts in the body When this balance is upset the volume of blood circulating throughoutthe body will fall dangerously low accompanied by adrop in blood pressure Addisons disease is also called primary adrenocorti cal insufficiency In other words some process interferesdirectly with the ability of the adrenal cortex to produceits hormones Levels of both cortisol and aldosteronedrop and numerous functions throughout the body aredisrupted Addisons disease occurs in about four in every people It strikes both men and women of all ages Causes and symptoms The most common cause of Addisons disease is the destruction andor shrinking atrophy of the adrenalcortex In about of all cases this atrophy isbelieved to occur due to an autoimmune disorder In anautoimmune disorder the immune system of the bodyresponsible for identifying foreign invaders such asviruses or bacteria and killing them accidentally beginsto identify the cells of the adrenal cortex as foreign anddestroy them In about of all cases destruction ofthe adrenal cortex is caused by tuberculosis The remaining cases of Addisons disease may be caused byfungal infections such as histoplasmosis coccidiomy cosis and cryptococcosis which affect the adrenal gland by producing destructive tumorlike masses GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Addisons diseaseGEM to A PM Page called granulomas a disease called amyloidosis i n which a starchy substance called amyloid is deposited inabnormal places throughout the body interfering withthe function of whatever structure it is present within orinvasion of the adrenal glands by cancer In about of all patients Addisons disease tends to be a very gradual slowly developing diseaseSignificant symptoms are not noted until about ofthe adrenal cortex has been destroyed The most common symptoms include fatigue and loss of energy decreased appetite nausea vomiting diarrhea abdominal pain weight loss muscle weakness dizzi ness when standing dehydration unusual areas of darkened pigmented skin and dark freckling As thedisease progresses the patient may appear to have verytanned or bronzed skin with darkening of the lining ofthe mouth vagina and rectum and dark pigmentationof the area around the nipples aereola As dehydrationbecomes more severe the blood pressure will continueto drop and the patient will feel increasingly weak andlightheaded Some patients have psychiatric symptoms including depression and irritability Women losepubic and underarm hair and stop having normal menstrual periods When a patient becomes ill with an infection or stressed by an injury the disease may suddenly andrapidly progress becoming lifethreatening Symptomsof this Addisonian crisis include abnormal heartrhythms severe pain in the back and abdomen uncontrollable nausea and vomiting a drastic drop in blood pressure kidney failure and unconsciousness About of all Addisons disease patients are identified dueto the development of Addisonian crisis Diagnosis Many patients do not recognize the slow progres sion of symptoms and the disease is ultimately identifiedwhen a physician notices the areas of increased pigmentation of the skin Once suspected a number of bloodtests can lead to the diagnosis of Addisons disease It isnot sufficient to demonstrate low blood cortisol levelsas normal levels of cortisol vary quite widely Insteadpatients are given a testing dose of another hormonecalled corticotropin ACTH ACTH is produced in thebody by the pituitary gland and normally acts by promoting growth within the adrenal cortex and stimulatingthe production and release of cortisol In Addisons disease even a dose of synthetic ACTH does not increasecortisol levels To distinguish between primary adrenocortical insufficiency Addisons disease and secondaryadrenocortical insufficiency caused by failure of thepituitary to produce enough ACTH levels of ACTH in the blood are examined Normal or high levels ofACTH indicate that the pituitary is working properlybut the adrenal cortex is not responding normally to thepresence of ACTH This confirms the diagnosis ofAddisons disease Treatment Treatment of Addisons disease involves replacing the missing or low levels of cortisol In the case of Addisonian crisis this will be achieved by injecting a potentform of steroid preparation through a needle placed in avein intravenous or IV Dehydration and salt loss willalso be treated by administering carefully balanced solutions through the IV Dangerously low blood pressuremay require special medications to safely elevate it untilthe steroids take effect Patients with Addisons disease will need to take a steroid preparation hydrocortisone and a replacementfor aldosterone fludrocortisone by mouth for the rest oftheir lives When a patient has an illness which causesnausea and vomiting such that they cannot hold downtheir medications he or she will need to enter a medicalfacility where IV medications can be administeredWhen a patient has any kind of infection or injury thenormal dose of hydrocortisone will need to be doubled Prognosis Prognosis for patients appropriately treated with hydrocortisone and aldosterone is excellent Thesepatients can expect to enjoy a

Located at the back of the mouth above and below the soft palate are two pairs of lymph glands The tonsilsbelow are clearly visible behind the back teeth the adenoids lie just above them and are hidden from view by thepalate Together these four arsenals of immune defenseguard the major entrance to the body from foreigninvadersthe germs we breathe and eat In contrast to therest of the bodys tissues lymphoid tissue reaches itsgreatest size in midchildhood and recedes thereafter Inthis way children are best able to develop the immunitiesthey need to survive in a world full of infectious diseases Beyond its normal growth pattern lymphoid tissue grows excessively hypertrophies during an acute infection as it suddenly increases its immune activity to fightoff the invaders Often it does not completely return to itsformer size Each subsequent infection leaves behind alarger set of tonsils and adenoids To make mattersworse the spongelike structure of these hypertrophiedglands can produce safe havens for germs where thebody cannot reach and eliminate them Before antibi otics and the reduction in infectious childhood diseases over the past few generations tonsils and adenoidscaused greater health problems Causes and symptoms Most tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy is simply caused by the normal growth pattern for that type of tissue Less often the hypertrophy is due to repeated throatinfections by cold viruses strep throat mononucleosis and in times gone by diphtheria The acute infections are usually referred to as tonsillitis the adenoids getting little recognition because they cannot be seen withoutspecial instruments Symptoms include painful brightred often ulcerated tonsils enlargement of lymph nodesglands beneath the jaw fever and general discomfort After the acute infection subsides symptoms are gen erated simply by the size of the glands Extremely largetonsils can impair breathing and swallowing although thatis quite rare Large

dead tissuenecrotic debris Viewing adenoids requires a small mirror or fiberoptic scope A child with recurring middle earinfections may well have large adenoids A throat cul ture or mononucleosis test will usually reveal the identi ty of the germ Treatment It used to be standard practice to remove tonsils andor adenoids after a few episodes of acute throat or earinfection The surgery is called tonsillectomy and ade noidectomy T and A Opinion changed as it was realized that this tissue is beneficial to the development of immunity For instance children without tonsils and adenoids produce only half the immunity to oral polio vaccine In addi tion treatment of ear and throat infections with antibioticsand of recurring ear infections with surgical drainagethrough the ear drum tympanostomy has greatly reducedthe incidence of surgical removal of these lymph glands Alternative treatment There are many botanicalherbal remedies that can be used alone or in formulas to locally assist the

and other young peoplewho live in institutional environments Outbreaks amongchildren are frequently reported at boarding schools andsummer camps Acquired immunity Most children have been infected by at least one adenovirus by the time they reach school age Mostadults have acquired immunity to multiple adenovirustypes due to infections they had as children In one mode of adenovirus infection called lytic infection because it destroys large numbers of cells adenoviruses kill healthy cells and replicate up to one million new viruses per cell killed of which are infectious People with this kind of infection feel sick Inchronic or latent infection a much smaller number ofviruses are released and healthy cells can multiply morerapidly than they are destroyed People who have thiskind of

six months to a stressful eventor situation It is not the same thing as posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD which usually occurs in reac tion to a lifethreatening event and can be longer lastingDescription An adjustment disorder usually begins within three months of a stressful event and ends within six monthsafter the stressor stops There are many different subtypes of adjustment disorders including adjustment disorder with depressionanxiety mixed anxiety and depression conduct disturbances mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct unspecified Adjustment disorders are very common and can affect anyone regardless of gender age race or lifestyleBy definition an adjustment disorder is shortlivedunless a person is faced with a chronic recurring crisissuch as a child who is repeatedly abused In such casesthe adjustment disorder may last more than six months Causes and symptoms An adjustment disorder occurs when a person cant cope with a stressful event and develops emotional orbehavioral symptoms The stressful event can be anythingit might be just one isolated incident or a string of problems that wears the person down The stress might be any thing from a car accident or illness to a divorce or even acertain time of year such as Christmas or summer People with adjustment disorder may have a wide variety of symptoms How those symptoms combinedepend on the particular subtype of adjustment disorderand on the individuals personality and psychologicaldefenses Symptoms normally include some but not allof the following hopelessness sadness crying anxiety

is extremely important that a thorough evaluation rule out other more serious mental disorders since thetreatment for adjustment disorder may be very differentthan for other mental problems In order to be diagnosed as a true adjustment disor der the level of distress must be more severe than whatwould normally be expected in response to the stressoror the symptoms must significantly interfere with a persons social job or school functioning Normal expression of grief in bereavement for instance is not considered an adjustment disorder Treatment Psychotherapy counseling is the treatment of choice for adjustment disorders since the symptoms arean understandable reaction to a specific stress The typeof therapy depends on the mental health expert but itusually is shortterm treatment that focuses on resolvingthe immediate problem Therapy usually will help clients develop coping skills understand how the stressor has affected their lives develop alternate social or recreational activities Family or couples therapy may be helpful in some cases Medications are not usually used to treat adjustment disorders although sometimes a few days or weeksof an antianxiety drug can control anxiety or sleepingproblems Selfhelp groups aimed at a specific problem such as recovering from divorce or job loss can be extremelyhelpful to people suffering from an adjustment disorderSocial support which is usually an important part of selfhelp groups can lead to a quicker recovery Prognosis Most people recover completely from adjustment disorders especially if they had no

can also occur in girls and women later in life Description In the normal human body there are two adrenal glands They are small structures that lie on top of the GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Adrenal virilismGEM to A PM Page kidneys The adrenal glands produce many hormones that regulate body functions These hormones includeandrogens or male hormones Androgens are producedin normal girls and women Sometimes one or both ofthe adrenal glands becomes enlarged or overactive producing more than the usual amount of androgens Theexcess androgens create masculine characteristics Causes and symptoms In infants and children adrenal virilism is usually the result of adrenal gland enlargement that is present atbirth This is called congenital adrenal hyperplasia The cause is usually a genetic problem that leads tosevere enzyme deficiencies In rare cases adrenal virilism is caused by an adrenal gland tumor The tumor canbe benign adrenal adenoma or cancerous adrenal carcinoma Sometimes virilism is

one located above each kidney thatproduce hormones such as epinephrine norepinephrineandrogens estrogens aldosterone and cortisol Adrenalectomy is usually performed by conventional opensurgery but in selected patients surgeons may uselaparoscopy With laparoscopy adrenalectomy can be accomplished through four very small incisions Purpose Adrenalectomy is usually advised for patients with tumors of the adrenal glands Adrenal gland tumors maybe malignant or benign but all typically excrete excessiveamounts of one or more hormones A successful procedure will aid in correcting hormone imbalances and mayalso remove cancerous tumors that can invade other partsof the body Occasionally adrenalectomy may be recommended when hormones produced by the adrenal glandsaggravate another condition such as breast cancer Precautions The adrenal glands are fed by numerous blood ves sels so surgeons need to be alert to extensive bleedingduring surgery In addition the adrenal glands lie close toone of the bodys major blood vessels the vena cavaand to the spleen and the pancreas The surgeon needs toremove the glands without damaging any of theseimportant and delicate organs Description Open adrenalectomy The surgeon may operate from any of four direc tions depending on the exact problem and the patientsbody type In the anterior approach the surgeon cuts into the abdominal wall Usually the incision will be horizontaljust under the rib cage If the surgeon intends to operateon only one of the adrenal glands the incision will rununder just the right or the left side of the rib cage Sometimes a vertical incision in the middle of the abdomenprovides a better approach especially if both adrenalglands are involved In the posterior approach the surgeon cuts into the back just beneath the rib cage If both glands are to beremoved an incision is made on each side of the bodyThis approach is the most direct route to the adrenalglands but it does not provide quite as clear a view of thesurrounding structures as the anterior approach In the flank approach the surgeon cuts into the patients side This is particularly useful in massively obesepatients If both glands need to be removed the surgeonmust remove one gland repair the surgical wound turn thepatient onto the other side and repeat the entire process The last approach involves an incision into the chest cavity either with or without part of the incision into theabdominal cavity It is used when the surgeon anticipatesa very large tumor or if the surgeon needs to examine orremove nearby structures as well Laparoscopic adrenalectomy This technique does not require the surgeon to open the body cavity Instead four small incisions about in diameter each are made into a patients flank justunder the rib cage A laparoscope which enables the surgeon to visualize the inside of the abdominal cavity on atelevision monitor is placed through one of the incisionsThe other incisions are for tubes that carry miniaturizedversions of surgical tools These tools are designed to beoperated by manipulations that the surgeon makes outside the body Preparation Most aspects of preparation are the same as in other major operations In addition hormone imbalances areoften a major challenge Whenever possible physicianswill try to correct hormone imbalances through medication in the days or weeks before surgery Adrenal tumorsmay cause other problems such as hypertension or inad equate potassium in the blood and these problems alsoshould be resolved if possible before surgery is performed Therefore a patient may take specific medicinesfor days or weeks before surgery Most adrenal tumors can be imaged very well with a CT scan or MRI and benign tumors tend to look different on these tests than do cancerous tumors Surgeonsmay order a CT scan MRI or scintigraphy viewing ofthe location of a tiny amount of radioactive agent to helplocate exactly where the tumor is GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

stays of about three days are indicated for opensurgery using the posterior approach or for laparoscopicadrenalectomy The special concern after adrenalectomy is the patients hormone balance There may be several sets oflab tests to define hormone problems and monitor theresults of drug treatment In addition blood pressureproblems and infections are more common after removalof certain types of

analyzing method immunoassay in many large laboratories However smaller laboratories are usually not equipped to perform this test and they may need to send the blood sample to a larger laboratory Because of this delay resultsmay take several days to obtain Description ACTH production is partly controlled by an area in the center of the brain the hypothalamus and partlycontrolled by the level of cortisol in the blood WhenACTH levels are too high cortisol production increasesto suppress ACTH release from the pituitary gland IfACTH levels are too low the hypothalamus producescorticotropinreleasing hormone CRH to stimulate thepituitary gland to make more ACTH ACTH levels rise inresponse to stress emotions injury infection burns surgery and decreased blood pressure Cushings syndrome Cushings syndrome is caused by an abnormally high level of circulating hydrocortisone The high level may bethe result of an adrenal gland tumor or enlargement ofboth adrenal glands due to a pituitary tumor The highlevel of hydrocortisone may be the result of taking corticosteroid drugs for a long time Corticosteroid drugs arewidely used for inflammation in disorders like rheuma

Description Adrenoleukodystrophy ALD is a member of a group of diseases leukodystrophies that cause damageto the myelin sheath of nerve cells Approximately one in people is affected by ALD There are three basicforms of ALD childhood adultonset and neonatal Thechildhood form of the disease is the classical form and isthe most severe Childhood ALD is progressive and usually leads to total disability or death It affects only boys because the genetic defect is sexlinked carried on the Xchromosome Onset usually occurs between ages fourand ten and can include many different symptoms not allof which appear together The most common symptomsare behavioral problems and poor memory Other symptoms frequently seen are loss of vision seizures poorlyarticulated speech difficulty swallowing deafness problems with gait and coordination fatigue increased skin pigmentation and progressive dementia The adultonset form of the disease also called adrenomyeloneuropathy is milder progresses slowly isusually associated with a normal life span and usuallyappears between ages Symptoms may includeprogressive stiffness weakness or paralysis of the lower limbs and loss of coordination Brain function deterioration may also been seen Women who are carriers of thedisease occasionally experience the same symptoms aswell as others including ataxia hypertonia excessivemuscle tone mild peripheral neuropathy and urinary problems The neonatal form affects both male andfemale infants and may produce mental retardation facial abnormalities seizures retinal degeneration poormuscle tone enlarged liver and adrenal dysfunctionNeonatal ALD usually progresses rapidly Causes and symptoms The genetic defect in ALD causes a decrease in the ability to degrade very long chain fatty acids These buildup in the adrenal glands brain plasma and fibroblastsThe buildup of very long chain fatty acids interfereswith the ability of the adrenal gland to convert cholesterol into steroids and causes demyelination of nerves inthe white matter of the brain Demyelinated nerve cellsare unable to function properly Diagnosis Diagnosis is made based on observed symptoms a biochemical test and a family history The biochemicaltest detects elevated levels of very long chain fatty acidsin samples from amniocentesis chorionic villi plasma red blood cells or fibroblasts A family history may indicate the likelihood of ALD because the disease is carriedon the Xchromosome by the female lineage of families Treatment Treatment for all forms of ALD consists of treating the symptoms and supporting the patient with physicaltherapy psychological counseling and special educationin some cases There is no cure for this disease and thereare no drugs that can reverse demyelination of nerve andbrain cells Dietary measures consist of reducing theintake of foods high in fat which are a source of verylong chain fatty acids A mixture called Lorenzos Oilhas been shown to reduce the level of

Definition Adult respiratory distress syndrome ARDS also called acute respiratory distress syndrome is a type oflung pulmonary failure that may result from any disease that causes large amounts of fluid to collect in thelungs ARDS is not itself a specific disease but a syndrome a group of symptoms and signs that make up oneof the most important forms of lung or respiratory fail ure It can develop quite suddenly in persons whose lungs have been perfectly normal Very often ARDS is atrue medical emergency The basic fault is a breakdownof the barrier or membrane that normally keeps fluidfrom leaking out of the small blood vessels of the lunginto the breathing sacs the alveoli Description Another name for ARDS is shock lung Its formal name is misleading because children as well as adultsmay be affected In the lungs the smallest blood vesselsor capillaries make contact with the alveoli tiny air sacsat the tips of the smallest breathing tubes the bronchiThis is the allimportant site where oxygen passes fromair that is inhaled to the blood which carries it to all partsof the body Any form of lung injury that damages thispoint of contact called the alveolocapillary junctionwill allow blood and tissue fluid to leak into the alveolieventually filling them so that air cannot enter The resultis the type of breathing distress called ARDS ARDS isone of the major causes of excess fluid in the lungs theother being heart failure Along with fluid there is a marked increase in inflamed cells in the lungs There also is debris left overfrom damaged lung cells and fibrin a semisolid material derived from blood in the tissues Typically thesematerials join together with large molecules in the bloodproteins to form hyaline membranes These membranes are very prominent in premature infants whodevelop respiratory distress syndrome it is often calledhyaline membrane disease If ARDS is very severe orlasts a long time the lungs do not heal but rather becomescarred a process known as fibrosis The lack of a normal amount of oxygen causes the blood vessels of thelung to become narrower and in time they too maybecome scarred and filled with clotted blood The lungsas a whole become very stiff and it becomes muchharder for the patient to breathe Causes and symptoms A very wide range of diseases or toxic substances including some drugs can cause ARDS They include Breathing in aspiration of the stomach contents when regurgitated or salt water or fresh water from nearlydrowning Inhaling smoke as in a fire toxic materials in the air such as ammonia or hydrocarbons or too much oxygen which itself can injure the lungs Infection by a virus or bacterium or sepsis a wide spread infection that gets into the blood Massive trauma with severe injury to any part of the body Shock with persistently low blood pressure may not in itself cause ARDS but it can be an important factor A blood clotting disorder called disseminated intravas cular coagulation in which blood clots form in vesselsthroughout the body including the lungs A large amount of fat entering the circulation and trav eling to the lungs where it lodges in small blood vessels injuring the cells lining the vessel walls An overdose of a narcotic drug a sedative or rarely aspirin GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Adult respiratory distress syndromeGEM to A PM Page Inflammation of the pancreas pancreatitis when blood proteins called enzymes pass to the lungs andinjure lung cells Severe burn injury Injury of the brain or bleeding into the brain from any cause may be a factor in ARDS for reasons that are notclear Convulsions also may cause some cases Usually ARDS develops within one to two days of the original illness or injury The person begins to take rapidbut shallow breaths The doctor who listens to the patientschest with a stethoscope may hear crackling or wheez ingsounds The low blood oxygen content may cause the skin to appear mottled or even blue As fluid continues tofill the breathing sacs the patient may have great troublebreathing take very rapid breaths and gasp for air Diagnosis A simple test using a device applied to the ear will show whether the blood is carrying too little oxygen andthis can be confirmed by analyzing blood taken from anartery The chest x ray may be normal in the early stages but in a short time fluid will be seen where it does notbelong The two lungs are about equally affected A heartof normal size indicates that the problem actually is ARDSand not heart failure Another way a physician can distinguish between these two possibilities is to place a catheterKEY TERMS Alveoli The tiny air sacs at the ends of the breath ing tubes of the lung where oxygen normally istaken up by the capillaries to enter the circulation Aspiration The process in which solid food liq uids or secretions that normally are swallowedare instead breathed into the lungs Capillaries The smallest arteries which in the lung are located next to the alveoli so that theycan pick up oxygen from inhaled air Face mask The simplest way of delivering a high level of oxygen to patients with ARDS or otherlowoxygen conditions Steroids A class of drugs resembling normal body substances that often help control inflammation in the body tissues Ventilator A mechanical device that can take over the work of breathing for a patient whoselungs are injured or are starting to healinto a vein and advance it into the main artery of the lung In this way the pressure within the pulmonary capillariescan be measured Pressure within the pulmonary capillaries is elevated in heart failure but normal in ARDS Treatment The three main goals in treating patients with ARDS are To treat whatever injury or disease has caused ARDS Examples are to treat septic infection with the properantibiotics and to reduce the level of oxygen therapy if ARDS has resulted from a toxic level of oxygen To control the process in the lungs that allows fluid to leak out of the blood vessels At present there is no certain way to achieve this Certain steroid hormones havebeen tried because they can combat inflammation butthe actual results have been disappointing To make sure the patient gets enough oxygen until the lung injury has had time to heal If oxygen delivered bya face mask is not enough the patient is placed on aventilator which takes over breathing and through atube placed in the nose or mouth or an incision in thewindpipe forces oxygen into the lungs This treatmentmust be closely supervised and the pressure adjustedso that too much oxygen is not delivered Patients with ARDS should be cared for in an inten sive care unit where experienced staff and all neededequipment are available Enough fluid must be providedby vein if necessary to prevent dehydration Also the patients nutritional state must be maintained again byvein if oral intake is not sufficient Prognosis If the patients lung injury does not soon begin to heal the lack of sufficient oxygen can injure other organssuch as the kidneys There always is a risk that bacterialpneumonia will develop at some point Without prompt treatment as many as of patients with ARDS can beexpected to die With modern treatment however abouthalf of all patients will survive Those who do live usuallyrecover completely with little or no longterm breathingdifficulty Lung scarring is a risk after a long period on aventilator but it may improve in the months after thepatient is taken off ventilation Whether a particularpatient will recover depends to a great extent on whetherthe primary disease that caused ARDS to develop in thefirst place can be effectively treated Prevention The only way to prevent ARDS is to avoid those dis eases and harmful conditions that damage the lung

commonly called middle age oper ations of the human body begin to be more vulnerable todaily wear and tear there is a general decline in physicaland possibly mental functioning In the Western countriesthe length of life is often into the s The upward limit ofthe life span however can be as high as years Duringthe latter half of life an individual is more prone to haveproblems with the various functions of the body and todevelop any number of chronic or fatal diseases The cardiovascular digestive excretory nervous reproductiveand urinary systems are particularly affected The mostcommon diseases of aging include Alzheimers arthritiscancer diabetes depression and heart disease Description Human beings reach a peak of growth and develop ment around the time of their mid s Aging is the normaltransition time after that flurry of activity Although thereare quite a few agerelated changes that tax the body disability is not necessarily a part of aging Health andlifestyle factors together with the genetic makeup of theindividual and determines the response to these changesBody functions that are most often affected by age include Hearing which declines especially in relation to the highest pitched tones The proportion of fat to muscle which may increase by as much as Typically the total padding of bodyfat directly under the skin thins out and accumulatesaround the stomach The ability to excrete fats isimpaired and therefore the storage of fats increasesincluding cholesterol and fatsoluble nutrients The amount of water in the body decreases which there fore decreases the absorption of watersoluble nutrientsAlso there is less saliva and other lubricating fluids The liver and the kidneys cannot function as efficiently thus affecting the elimination of wastes A decrease in the ease of digestion with a decrease in stomach acid production A loss of muscle strength and coordination with an accompanying loss of mobility agility and flexibility A decline in sexual hormones and sexual functioning A decrease in the sensations of taste and smell Changes in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems leading to decreased oxygen and nutrients throughoutthe body Decreased functioning of the nervous system so that nerve impulses are not transmitted as efficiently reflexes are not as sharp and memory and learning arediminished A decrease in bone strength and density Hormone levels which gradually decline The thyroid and sexual hormones are particularly affected Declining visual abilities Agerelated changes may lead to diseases such as macular degeneration GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AgingGEM to A PM Page A compromised ability to produce vitamin D from sun light A reduction in protein formation leading to shrinkage in muscle mass and decreased bone formation possiblyleading to osteoporosis Causes and symptoms There are several theories as to why the aging body loses functioning It may be that several factors worktogether or that one particular factor is at work more thanothers in a given individual Programmed senescence or aging clock theory The aging of the cells of each individual is programmed intothe genes and there is a preset number of possible rejuvenations in the life of a given cell When cells die at arate faster than they are replaced organs do not function properly and they are soon unable to maintain thefunctions necessary for life Genetic theory Human cells maintain their own seed of destruction at the level of the chromosomes Connective tissue or crosslinking theory Changes in the makeup of the connective tissue alter the stabilityof body structures causing a loss of elasticity and functioning and leading to symptoms of aging Freeradical theory The most commonly held theory of aging it is based on the fact that ongoing chemicalreactions of the cells produce free radicals In the presence of oxygen these free radicals cause the cells of thebody to break down As time goes on more cells die orlose the ability to function and the body soon ceases tofunction as a whole Immunological theory There are changes in the immune system as it begins to wear out and the body is moreprone to infections and tissue damage which may finallycause death Also as the system breaks down the body is more apt to have autoimmune reactions in which thebodys own cells are mistaken for foreign material andare destroyed or damaged by the immune system Diagnosis Many problems can arise due to agerelated changes in the body Although there is no one test to be given athorough physical exam and a basic blood screening andblood chemistry panel can point to areas in need of further attention When older people become ill the firstsigns of disease are often nonspecific Further examsshould be conducted if any of the following occur diminished or lack of desire for food increasing confusion failure to thrive urinary incontinence dizziness weight loss falling Treatment For the most part doctors prescribe medications to control the symptoms and diseases of aging In the United States about twothirds of people and over takemedications for various complaints More women thanmen use these medications The most common drugsused by the elderly are painkillers diuretics or water pills sedatives cardiac drugs antibiotics and mental health drugs Estrogen replacement therapy ERT is commonly prescribed to postmenopausal women for symptoms ofaging It is often used in conjunction with progesteroneERT functions to help keep bones strong reduce risk ofheart disease restore vaginal lubrication and to improveskin elasticity Evidence suggests that it may also helpmaintain mental functions Expected results Aging is unavoidable but major physical impair ment is not People can lead a healthy disabilityfree lifewell through their later years A well established supportsystem of family friends and health care providerstogether with focus on good nutrition and lifestyle habits and good stress management can prevent disease and lessen the impact of chronic conditions Alternative treatment Nutritional supplements Consumption of a highquality multivitamin is rec ommended Common nutritional deficiencies connectedwith aging include B vitamins vitamins A and C folic acid calcium magnesium zinc iron chromium and trace minerals Since stomach acids may be decreased it is suggested that the use of a powdered multivitamin formula in gelatin capsules be used as this form is the easiest to digest Such formulas may also contain enzymesfor further help with digestion Antioxidants can help to neutralize damage by the free radical actions thought to contribute to problems ofaging They are also helpful in preventing and treatingcancer and in treating cataracts and glaucoma Supple ments that

The term isused to describe an irrational and often disabling fear ofbeing out in public Description Agoraphobia is just one type of phobia or irrational fear People with phobias feel dread or panic when they face certain objects situations or activities People withagoraphobia frequently also experience panic attacks butpanic attacks or panic disorder are not a requirement for a diagnosis of agoraphobia The defining feature ofagoraphobia is anxiety about being in places from which escape might be embarrasing or difficult or in whichhelp might be unavailable The person suffering fromagoraphobia usually avoids the anxietyprovoking situation and may become totally housebound Causes and symptoms Agoraphobia is the most common type of phobia and it is estimated to affect between of Americans withintheir lifetime Agoraphobia is twice as common in womenas in men and usually strikes between the ages of The symptoms of the panic attacks which may accompany agoraphobia vary from person to person andmay include trembling sweating heart palpitations a feeling of the heart pounding against the chest jittersfatigue tingling in the hands and feet nausea a rapid pulse or breathing rate and a sense of impending doom Agoraphobia and other phobias are thought to be the result of a number of physical and environmental factorsFor instance they have been associated with biochemicalimbalances especially related to certain neurotransmitters chemical nerve messengers in the brain Peoplewho have a panic attack in a given situation eg a shopping mall may begin to associate the panic with that situation and learn to avoid it According to some theoriesirrational anxiety results from unresolved emotional conflicts All of these factors may play a role to varyingextents in different cases of agoraphobia GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AgoraphobiaGEM to A PM Page Diagnosis People who suffer from panic attacks should discuss the problem with a physician The doctor can diagnosethe underlying panic or anxiety disorder and make surethe symptoms arent related to some other underlyingmedical condition The doctor makes the diagnosis of agoraphobia based primarily on the patients description of his or hersymptoms The person with agoraphobia experiencesanxiety in situations where escape is difficult or help isunavailableor in certain situations such as being aloneWhile many people are somewhat apprehensive in thesesituations the hallmark of agoraphobia is that a personsactive avoidance of the feared situation impairs his or herability to work socialize or otherwise function Treatment Treatment for agoraphobia usually consists of both medication and psychotherapy Usually patients canbenefit from certain antidepressants such as amitriptyline Elavil or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as paroxetine Paxil fluoxetine Prozac or sertraline Zoloft In addition patients may manage panicattacks in progress with certain tranquilizers called ben zodiazepines such as alprazolam Xanax or clon azepam Klonipin The mainstay of treatment for agoraphobia and other phobias is cognitive behavioral therapy A specific technique that is often employed is called desensitizationThe patient is gradually exposed to the situation that usually triggers fear and avoidance and with the help ofbreathing or relaxation techniques learns to cope withthe situation This helps break the mental connectionbetween the situation and the fear anxiety or panicPatients may also benefit from psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy discussing underlying emotionalconflicts with a therapist or support group Prognosis With proper medication and psychotherapy of patients will find significant improvement in their symptoms Resources BOOKS Hallowell Edward

deficiency syndrome AIDS is an infectious disease caused by the human immunodeficien cyvirus HIV It was first recognized in the United States in AIDS is the advanced form of infection with theHIV virus which may not cause recognizable disease for along period after the initial exposure latency No vaccineis currently available to prevent HIV infection At presentall forms of AIDS therapy are focused on improving thequality and length of life for AIDS patients by slowing orhalting the replication of the virus and treating or preventing infections and cancers that take advantage of a persons weakened immune system Description AIDS is considered one of the most devastating public health problems in recent history In June the Centers GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AIDSGEM to A PM Page for Disease Control and Prevention CDC reported that includes only those cases in areas that have confidential HIV reporting in the United States are HIVpositive and are living with AIDS includes only thosecases where vital status is known Of these patients are gay or bisexual men are heterosexual intravenousdrug users and are women In addition approximately children are born each year with HIV infection The World Health Organization WHO estimates that million adults and million children worldwide wereliving with HIVAIDS as of with million beingnewly infected that year Most of these cases are in thedeveloping countries of Asia and Africa Risk factors AIDS can be transmitted in several ways The risk factors for HIV transmission vary according to category Sexual contact Persons at greatest risk are those who do not practice safe sex those who are not monogamous those who participate in anal intercourse andthose who have sex with a partner with symptoms ofadvanced HIV infection andor other sexually trans mitted diseases STDs In the United States and Europe most cases of sexually transmitted HIV infection have resulted from homosexual contact whereas inAfrica the disease is spread primarily through sexualintercourse among heterosexuals Transmission in pregnancy Highrisk mothers include women married to bisexual men or men who have anabnormal blood condition called hemophilia and require blood transfusions intravenous drug users andwomen living in neighborhoods with a high rate of HIVinfection among heterosexuals The chances of trans mitting the disease to the child are higher in women inadvanced stages of the disease Breast feeding increasesthe risk of transmission by The use of zidovudine AZT during pregnancy however can decreasethe risk of transmission to the baby Exposure to contaminated blood or blood products With the introduction of blood product screening in themids the incidence of HIV transmission in bloodtransfusions has dropped to one in every transfused With respect to HIV transmission among drugabusers risk increases with the duration of using injections the frequency of needle sharing the number ofpersons who share a needle and the number of AIDScases in the local population Needle sticks among health care professionals Present studies indicate that the risk of HIV transmission by a needle stick is about one in This rate can be decreased ifthe injured worker is given AZT an antiretroviral medication in combination with other medication HIV is not transmitted by handshakes or other casu al nonsexual contact coughing or sneezing or by bloodsucking insects such as mosquitoes AIDS in women AIDS in women is a serious public health concern Women exposed to HIV infection through heterosexualcontact are the most rapidly

process orthrough breast milk all infants born to HIVpositive mothers are a highrisk group As of it was estimated that of HIVpositive women are of childbearing age of them are drug abusers Between of children bornto HIVpositive women will be infected with the virus AIDS is one of the leading causes of death in chil dren between one and four years of age The intervalbetween exposure to HIV and the development of AIDS isshorter in children than in adults Infants infected with HIVhave a chance of developing AIDS within a yearand dying before age three In the remainder AIDS progresses more slowly the average child patient survives toseven years of age Some survive into early adolescence Causes and symptoms Because HIV destroys immune system cells AIDS is a disease that can affect any of the bodys major organsystems HIV attacks the body through three diseaseprocesses immunodeficiency autoimmunity and ner vous system dysfunction Immunodeficiency describes the condition in which the bodys immune response is damaged weakened or isnot functioning properly In AIDS immunodeficiencyresults from the way that the virus binds to a protein calledCD which is primarily found on the surface of certainsubtypes of white blood cells called helper T cells or CDcells After the virus has attached to the CD receptor thevirusCD complex refolds to uncover another receptorcalled a chemokine receptor that helps to mediate entry ofthe virus into the cell One chemokine receptor in particular CCR has gotten recent attention after studies showedthat defects in its structure caused by genetic mutationscause the progression of AIDS to be prevented or slowedScientists hope that this discovery will lead to the development of drugs that trigger an artificial mutation of theCCR gene or target the CCR receptor Once HIV has entered the cell it can replicate intra cellularly and kill the cell in ways that are still not completely understood In addition to killing some lymphocytes directly the

surface of the lymphocyte right of center Photograph by Scott Camazir Photo Researchers Inc Reproduced by permissionGEM to A PM Page the remaining CD cells Because the immune system cells are destroyed many different types of infectionsand cancers that take advantage of a persons weakenedimmune system opportunistic can develop Autoimmunity is a condition in which the bodys immune system produces antibodies that work against itsown cells Antibodies are specific proteins produced inresponse to exposure to a specific usually foreign proteinor particle called an antigen In this case the body produces antibodies that bind to blood platelets that are necessary for proper blood clotting and tissue repair Oncebound the antibodies mark the platelets for removal fromthe body and they are filtered out by the spleen SomeAIDS patients develop a disorder called immunerelatedthrombocytopenia purpura ITP in which the number of blood platelets drops to abnormally low levels As of researchers do not know precisely how HIV attacks the nervous system since the virus can causedamage without infecting nerve cells directly One theoryis that once infected with HIV one type of immune system cell called a macrophage begins to release a toxinthat harms the nervous system The course of AIDS generally progresses through three stages although not all patients will follow thisprogression precisely Acute retroviral syndrome Acute retroviral syndrome is a term used to describe a group of symptoms that can resemble mononucleosisand that may be the first sign of HIV infection in of all patients and of women Most patients arenot recognized as infected during this phase and may notseek medical attention The symptoms may includefever fatigue muscle aches loss of appetite digestive disturbances weight loss skin rashes headache and chronically swollen lymph nodes lymphadenopathyApproximately of patients will experience aform of meningitis during this phase in which the mem branes that cover the brain and spinal cord becomeinflamed Acute retroviral syndrome develops betweenone and six weeks after infection and lasts for two tothree weeks Blood tests during this period will indicatethe presence of virus viremia and the appearance of theviral p antigen in the blood Latency period After the HIV virus enters a patients lymph nodes during the acute retroviral syndrome stage the diseasebecomes latent for as many as years or more beforesymptoms of advanced disease develop During latencythe virus continues to replicate in the lymph nodes whereit may cause one or more of the following conditionsPERSISTENT GENERALIZED LYMPHADENOPATHY PGL Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy or PGL is a condition in which HIV continues to produce chronic painlessswellings in the lymph nodes during the latency periodThe lymph nodes that are most frequently affected by PGLare those in the areas of the neck jaw groin and armpitsPGL affects between of patients during latency CONSTITUTIONAL SYMPTOMS Many patients will develop lowgrade fevers chronic fatigue and generalweakness HIV may also cause a combination of foodmalabsorption loss of appetite and increased metabolism

look for the overall pattern of symptoms rather than any one finding Laboratory tests for HIV infection BLOOD TESTS SEROLOGY The first blood test for AIDS was developed in At present patients whoare being tested for HIV infection are usually given anenzymelinked immunosorbent assay ELISA test for thepresence of HIV antibody in their blood Positive ELISAresults are then tested with a Western blot or immunofluorescence IFA assay for confirmation The combinationof the ELISA and Western blot tests is more than GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AIDSGEM to A PM Page accurate in detecting HIV infection within four to eight weeks following exposure The polymerase chain reaction PCR test can be used to detect the presence of viralnucleic acids in the very small number of HIV patientswho have falsenegative results on the ELISA and Western blot tests These tests are also used to detect virusesand bacterium other than HIV and AIDS OTHER LABORATORY TESTS In addition to diagnos tic blood tests there are other blood tests that are used totrack the course of AIDS in patients that have alreadybeen diagnosed These include blood counts viral loadtests p antigen assays and measurements of H microglobulin HM Doctors will use a wide variety of tests to diagnose the presence of opportunistic infections cancers or other disease conditions in AIDS patients Tissue biopsies samples ofcerebrospinal fluid and sophisticated imaging techniquessuch as magnetic resonance imaging MRI and computed tomography scans CT are used to diagnose AIDSrelated cancers some opportunistic infections damage to the centralnervous system and wasting of the muscles Urine and stoolsamples are used to diagnose infections caused by parasitesAIDS patients are also given blood tests for syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases Diagnosis in children Diagnostic blood testing in children older than months is similar to adult testing with ELISA screeningconfirmed by Western blot Younger infants can be diagnosed by direct culture of the HIV virus PCR testingand p antigen testing In terms of symptoms children are less likely than adults to have an early acute syndrome They are however likely to have delayed growth a history of frequentillness recurrent ear infections a low blood cell countfailure to gain weight and unexplained fevers Childrenwith AIDS are more likely to develop bacterial infections inflammation of the lungs and AIDSrelated braindisorders than are HIVpositive adults Treatment Treatment for AIDS covers four considerations TREATMENT OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS AND MALIGNANCIES Most AIDS patients require complex longterm treatment with medications for infectious diseases This treatment is often complicated by the development of resistance in the disease organisms AIDSrelated malignancies in the central nervous system areusually treated with radiation therapy Cancers else where in the body are treated with chemotherapy PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT FOR OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS Prophylactic treatment is treatment that is given to prevent disease AIDS patients with a history ofPneumocystis pneumonia with CD counts below cellsmm or of lymphocytes weight loss or thrush should be given prophylactic medications The threedrugs given are trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole dapsone or pentamidine in aerosol form ANTIRETROVIRAL TREATMENT In recent years researchers have developed drugs that suppress HIVreplication as distinct from treating its effects on thebody These drugs fall into three classes Nucleoside analogues These drugs work by interfering

antiretroviral agents Three are availablenevirapine which was approved first delavirdine andefavirin Treatment guidelines for these agents are in constant change as new medications are developed and introduced Two principles currently guide doctors in workingout drug regimens for AIDS patients using combinationsof drugs rather than one medication alone and basingtreatment decisions on the results of the patients viralload tests STIMULATION OF BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION Because many patients with AIDS suffer from abnormally low levels of both red and white blood cells they maybe given medications to stimulate blood cell productionEpoetin alfa erythropoietin may be given to anemicpatients Patients with low white blood cell counts maybe given filgrastim or sargramostim Treatment in women Treatment of pregnant women with HIV is particu larly important in that antiretroviral therapy has beenshown to reduce transmission to the infant by Alternative treatment Alternative treatments for AIDS can be grouped into two categories those intended to help the immune sys GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AIDSGEM to A PM Page tem and those aimed at pain control Treatments that may enhance the function of the immune system includeChinese herbal medicine and western herbal medicinemacrobiotic and other special diets guided imagery and creative visualization homeopathy and vitamin therapy Pain control therapies include hydrotherapy reiki acupuncture meditation chiropractic treatments and therapeutic massage Alternative therapies can also beused to help with side effects of the medications used inthe treatment of AIDS Prognosis At the present time there is no cure for AIDS Treatment stresses aggressive combination drug therapy for those patients with access to the expensivemedications and who tolerate them adequately The useof these multidrug therapies has significantly reducedthe numbers of deaths in this country resulting fromAIDS The data is still inconclusive but the potentialexists to possibly prolong life indefinitely using theseand other drug therapies to boost the immune systemkeep the virus from replicating and ward off opportunistic infections and malignancies Prognosis after the latency period depends on the patients specific symptoms and the organ systemsaffected by the disease Patients with AIDSrelated lymphomas of the central nervous system die within two tothree months of diagnosis those with systemic lymphomas may survive for eight to ten months Prevention As of there is no vaccine effective against AIDS Several vaccines are currently being investigatedhowever both to prevent initial HIV infection and as atherapeutic treatment to prevent HIV from progressing tofullblown AIDS In the meantime there are many things that can be done to prevent the spread of AIDS Be monogamous and practice safe sex Individuals must be instructed in the proper use of condoms andurged to practice safe sex Besides avoiding the risk ofHIV infection condoms are successful in preventingother sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies Before engaging in a sexual relationship withsomeone get tested for HIV infection Avoid needle sharing among intravenous drug users Although blood and blood products are carefully moni tored those individuals who are planning to undergomajor surgery may wish to donate blood ahead of timeto prevent a risk of infection from a blood transfusion Healthcare professionals must taken all necessary pre cautions by wearing gloves and masks when handlingbody fluids and preventing needlestick injuries If you suspect that you may have become infected get tested for HIV infection If treated aggressively earlyon the development of AIDS may be postponed indefinitely If HIV infection is confirmed it is

Service website January httphivatisorg Rebecca J Frey AIDS serology seeAIDS tests GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AIDSGEM to A PM Page AIDS tests Definition AIDS tests short for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome tests cover a number of different proceduresused in the diagnosis and treatment of HIV patients Thesetests are sometimes called AIDS serology tests Serologyis the branch of immunology that deals with the contentsand characteristics of blood serum Serum is the clear lightyellow part of blood that remains liquid when blood cellsform a clot AIDS serology evaluates the presence ofhuman immunodeficiency virus HIV infection in bloodserum and its effects on each patients immune system Purpose AIDS serology serves several different purposes Some AIDS tests are used to diagnose patients or confirm a diagnosis others are used to measure the progression of the disease or the effectiveness of specific treatment regimens Some AIDS tests can also be used toscreen blood donations for safe use in transfusions In order to understand the different purposes of the blood tests used with AIDS patients it is helpful tounderstand how HIV infection affects human blood andthe immune system HIV is a retrovirus that enters theblood stream of a new host in the following ways by sexual contact by contact with infected body fluids such as blood and urine by transmission during pregnancy o r through transfusion of infected blood products A retrovirus is a virus that contains a unique enzyme called reverse transcriptase that allows it to replicate within new host cells The virus binds to a protein called CDwhich is found on the surface of certain subtypes of whiteblood cells including helper T cells macrophages andmonocytes Once HIV enters the cell it can replicate andkill the cell in ways that are still not completely understood In addition to killing some lymphocytes directly theAIDS virus disrupts the functioning of the remaining CDcells CD cells ordinarily produce a substance calledinterleukin IL which stimulates other cells T cellsand B cells in the human immune system to respond toinfections Without the IL T cells do not reproduce asthey normally would in response to the HIV virus and Bcells are not stimulated to respond to the infection Precautions In some states such as New York a signed consent form is needed in order to administer an AIDS test Aswith all blood tests healthcare professionals shouldalways wear latex gloves and to avoid being pricked bythe needle used in drawing blood for the tests Also itmay be difficult to get blood from a habitual intravenousdrug user due to collapsed veins Description Diagnostic tests Diagnostic blood tests for AIDS are usually given to persons in highrisk populations who may have beenexposed to HIV or who have the early symptoms ofAIDS Most persons infected with HIV will develop adetectable level of antibody within three months of infection The condition of testing positive for HIV antibodyin the blood is called seroconversion and persons whohave become HIVpositive are called seroconverters It is possible to diagnose HIV infection by isolating the virus itself from a blood sample or by demonstratingthe presence of HIV antigen in the blood Viral culturehowever is expensive not widely available and slowittakes days to complete the viral culture test Morecommon are blood tests that work by detecting the presence of antibodies to the HIV virus These tests are inexpensive widely available and accurate in detecting of AIDS infections when used in combination toscreen patients and confirm diagnoses ENZYMELINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY ELISA This type of blood test is used to screen blood for transfusions as well as diagnose patients An ELISA test forHIV works by attaching HIV antigens to a plastic well orbeads A sample of the patients blood serum is addedand excess proteins are removed A second antibody coupled to an enzyme is added followed by addition of asubstance that will cause the enzyme to react by forminga color An instrument called a spectrophotometer canmeasure the color The name of the test is derived fromthe use of the enzyme that is coupled or linked to the second antibody The latest generation of ELISA tests are sen sitive to HIV Occasionally the ELISA test will be positive for a patient without symptoms of AIDS from a lowrisk group Because this result is likely to be a falsepositive the ELISA must be repeated on the same sample of the patients blood If the second ELISA is positive the result should be confirmed by the Western blot test WESTERN BLOT IMMUNOBLOT The Western blot or immunoblot test is used as a reference procedure toconfirm the diagnosis of AIDS In Western blot testingHIV antigen is purified by electrophoresis large proteinmolecules are suspended in a gel and separated from oneanother by running an electric current through the gel GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AIDS testsGEM to A PM Page The HIV antigens are attached by blotting to a nylon or nitrocellulose filter The patients serum is reacted againstthe filter followed by treatment with developing chemicals that allow HIV antibody to show up as a coloredpatch or blot A commercially produced Western blot testfor HIV is now available It consists of a prefabricatedstrip that is incubated with a sample of the patients bloodserum and the developing chemicals About nine differentHIV proteins can be detected in the blots When used in combination with ELISA testing Western blot testing is specific It can howeveryield false negatives in patients with very early HIVinfection and in those infected by HIV In somepatients the Western blot yields indeterminate results IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE ASSAY IFA This method is sometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead ofWestern blotting An IFA test detects the presence ofHIV antibody in a sample of the patients serum by mixing HIV antigen with a fluorescent chemical adding theblood sample and observing the reaction under a microscope with ultraviolet light POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION PCR This test is used to evaluate the very small number of AIDS patientswith falsenegative ELISA and Western blot tests Thesepatients are sometimes called antibodynegative asymptomatic without symptoms carriers because they do nothave any symptoms of AIDS and there is no detectablequantity of antibody in the blood serum Antibodynegative asymptomatic carriers may be responsible for thevery low ongoing risk of HIV infection transmitted byblood transfusions It is estimated that the risk is between in and in units of transfused blood The polymerase chain reaction PCR test can mea sure the presence of viral nucleic acids in the patientsblood even when there is no detectable antibody to HIV This test works by amplifying the presence of HIV nucleic acids in a blood sample Numerous copies of a gene aremade by separating the two strands of DNA containingthe gene segment marking its location using DNA polymerase to make a copy and then continuously replicatingthe copies It is questionable whether PCR will replaceWestern blotting as the method of confirming AIDS diagnoses Although PCR can detect the low number of persons with HIV infections that have not yet generatedan antibody response to the virus the overwhelmingmajority of infected persons will be detected by ELISAscreening within one to three months of infection Inaddition PCR testing is based on present knowledge ofthe genetic sequences in HIV Since the virus is continually generating new variants PCR testing could yield afalse negative in patients with these new variantsIn the US Food and Drug Administration FDA approved an HIV home testing kit The kit containsmultiple components including material for specimen collection a mailing envelope to send the specimen to a laboratory for analysis and provides pre and posttest counseling It uses a finger prick process for blood collectionThe results are obtained by the purchaser through a tollfree telephone number using a personal identificationnumber PIN Post test counseling is provided over thetelephone by a licensed counselor The only kit approvedby the FDA as of was the Home Access test system Prognostic tests Blood tests to evaluate patients already diagnosed with HIV infection are as important as the diagnostictests Because AIDS has a long latency period some persons may be infected with the virus for years or longerbefore they develop symptoms of AIDS These patientsare sometimes called antibodypositive asymptomaticcarriers Prognostic tests also help drug researchers evaluate the usefulness of new medications in treating AIDS BLOOD CELL COUNTS Doctors can measure the number or proportion of certain types of cells in an AIDSpatients blood to see whether and how rapidly the disease is progressing or whether certain treatments arehelping the patient These cell count tests include Complete blood count CBC A CBC is a routine analy sis performed on a

SouthAmerica and most parts of Africa and HIV whichis chiefly found in West African patients HIV discovered in appears to be less virulent than HIV but may also have a longer latency period Immunofluorescent assay IFA A blood test sometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead ofusing the Western blotting In an IFA test HIV antigen is mixed with a fluorescent compound and thenwith a sample of the patients blood If HIV antibodyis present the mixture will fluoresce when examined under ultraviolet light Lymphocyte A type of white blood cell that is important in the formation of antibodies Doctors of an immune response Because HIV targets CD lymphocytes their number in the patients blood canbe used to track the course of the infection This bloodcell count is considered the most accurate indicatorfor the presence of an opportunistic infection in anAIDS patient The absolute CD lymphocyte countis obtained by multiplying the patients white bloodcell count WBC by the percentage of lymphocytesamong the white blood cells and multiplying theresult by the percentage of lymphocytes bearing theCD marker An absolute count below CD lymphocytes in cubic millimeter mm of blood indicates that the patient is vulnerable to someopportunistic infections GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AIDS testsGEM to A PM Page CD lymphocyte percentage Some doctors think that this is a more accurate test than the absolute countbecause the percentage does not depend on a manualcalculation of the number of types of different whiteblood cells A white blood cell count that is brokendown into categories in this way is called a WBC differential It is important for doctors treating AIDS patients to measure the lymphocyte count on a regular basisExperts consulted by the United States Public HealthService recommend the following frequency of serumtesting based on the patients CD level CD count more than cellsmm Every six monthsKEY TERMS can monitor the health of AIDS patients by measur

HIV CD lymphocytes are a subset of T lymphocytes Viral load test A new blood test for monitoring the speed of HIV replication in AIDS patients The viralload test is based on PCR techniques and supplements the CD cell count tests Western blot A technique developed in that is used to confirm ELISA results HIV antigen is purified by electrophoresis and attached by blotting to anylon or nitrocellulose filter The patients serum isreacted against the filter followed by treatment withdeveloping chemicals that allow HIV antibody toshow up as a colored patch or blot If the patient isHIVpositive there will be stripes at specific locations for two or more viral proteins A negativeresult is blank WBC differential A white blood cell count in which the technician classifies the

months CD count less than cellsmm Every three months When the CD count falls below cellsmm the doctor will put the patient on a medication regimen toprotect him or her against opportunistic infections HIV VIRAL LOAD TESTS Another type of blood test for monitoring AIDS patients is the viral load test It supplements the CD count which can tell the doctor theextent of the patients loss of immune function but notthe speed of HIV replication in the body The viral loadtest is based on PCR techniques and can measure the GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AIDS testsGEM to A PM Page number of copies of HIV nucleic acids Successive test results for a given patients viral load are calculated on abase logarithmic scale BETAMICROGLOBULIN HMBetamicroglobulin is a protein found on the surface of all human cells witha nucleus It is released into the blood when a cell diesAlthough rising blood levels of H M are found in patients with cancer and other serious diseases a rising HM blood level can be used to measure the progression of AIDS P ANTIGEN CAPTURE ASSAY Found in the viral core of HIV p is a protein that can be measured bythe ELISA technique Doctors can use p assays tomeasure the antiviral activity of the patients medications In addition the p assay is sometimes useful indetecting HIV infection before seroconversion However p is consistently present in only of personsinfected with HIV GENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TEST Genotypic testing can help determine whether specific gene mutations common in people with HIV are causing drugresistance and drug failure The test looks for specificgenetic mutations of within the virus that are known tocause resistance to certain drugs used in HIV treatmentFor example the drug TC also known as lamivudineEpivir is not effective against strains of HIV that havea mutation at a particular position on the reverse transcriptase proteinamino acid known as MVMLV methionine to valine So if the genotypic resis tance test shows a mutation at position MV it is likely that person is resistant to TC and not likely torespond to TC treatment Genotypic tests are onlyeffective if the person is already taking antiviral medication and if the viral load is greater than copies permilliliter mL of blood The cost of the test usuallybetween and is usually now covered bymany insurance plans PHENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TESTING Pheno typic testing directly measures the sensitivity of apatients HIV to particular drugs and drug combinationsTo do this it measures the concentration of a drugrequired to inhibit viral replication in the test tube Thisis the same method used by researchers to determinewhether a drug might be effective against HIV beforeusing it in human clinical trials Phenotypic testing is amore direct measurement of resistance than genotypictesting Also unlike genotypic testing phenotypic testing does not require a high viral load but it is recommended that persons already be taking antiretroviral drugs The cost is between and and is now covered by many insurance plansAIDS serology in children Children born to HIVinfected mothers may acquire the infection through the mothers placenta or during thebirth process Public health experts recommend the testing and monitoring of all children born to mothers withHIV Diagnostic testing in children older than monthsis similar to adult testing with ELISA screening confirmed by Western blot Younger infants can be diagnosedby direct culture of the HIV virus PCR testing and pantigen testing These techniques allow a pediatrician toidentify of infected children at or near birth and of cases in infants three to six months of age Preparation Preparation and aftercare are important parts of AIDS diagnostic testing Doctors are now advised to take thepatients emotional social economic and other circumstances into account and to provide counseling before andafter testing Patients are generally better able to cope withthe results if the doctor has spent some time with thembefore the blood test explaining the basic facts about HIVinfection and testing Many doctors now offer this type ofinformational counseling before performing the tests Aftercare If the test results indicate that the patient is HIV pos itive he or she will need counseling information referralfor treatment and support Doctors can either counsel thepatient themselves or invite an experienced HIV counselor to discuss the results of the blood tests with thepatient They will also assess the patients emotional andpsychological status including the possibility of violentbehavior and the availability of a support network Risks The risks of AIDS testing are primarily related to disclosure of the patients HIV status rather than to anyphysical risks connected with blood testing Somepatients are better prepared to cope with a positive diagnosis than others depending on their age sex healthresources belief system and similar factors Normal results Normal results for ELISA Western blot IFA and PCR testing are negative for HIV antibody Normal results for blood cell counts WBC differential Total lymphocytes of the white blood cells Hematocrit in men in women

Alanine aminotransferase test Definition The alanine aminotransferase test also known as ALT is one of a group of tests known as liver function tests or LFTs and is used to monitor damage to the liver Purpose ALT levels are used to detect liver abnormalities Since the alanine aminotransferase enzyme is also foundin muscle tests indicating elevated AST levels might alsoindicate muscle damage However other tests such as GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Alanine aminotransferase testGEM to A PM Page the levels of the MB fraction of creatine kinase should indicate whether the abnormal test levels are because ofmuscle or liver damage Description The alanine aminotransferase test ALT can reveal liver damage It is probably the most specific test forliver damage However the severity of the liver damageis not necessarily shown by the ALT test since theamount of dead liver tissue does not correspond to higherALT levels Also patients with normal or decliningALT levels may experience serious liver damage withoutan increase in ALT Nevertheless ALT is widely used and useful because ALT levels are elevated in most patients withliver disease Although ALT levels do not necessarilyindicate the severity of the damage to the liver they mayindicate how much of the liver has been damaged ALTlevels when compared to the levels of a similar enzymeaspartate aminotransferase AST may provide important clues to the nature of the liver disease For examplewithin a certain range of values a ratio of or greaterfor AST ALT might indicate that a patient suffers fromalcoholic liver disease Other diagnostic data may begleaned from ALT tests to indicate abnormal results Preparation No special preparations are necessary for this test Aftercare This test involves blood being drawn probably from a vein in the patients elbow The patient should keep thewound from the needle puncture covered with a bandage until the bleeding stops Patients should report anyunusual symptoms to their physician Normal results Normal values vary from laboratory to laboratory and should be available to your physician at the time ofthe test An informal survey of some laboratories indicates many laboratories find values from approximatelyseven to IUL to be normal Abnormal results Low levels of ALT generally below IUL may indicate any kind of liver disease Levels above IUL generally indicate extensive liver damage from toxins or drugs viral hepatitis or a lack of oxygen usuallyresulting from very low blood pressure or a heart attack A briefly elevated ALT above IUL thatresolves in hours may indicate a blockage of the bile duct More moderate levels of ALT IULmay support a diagnosis of acute or chronic hepatitis It is important to note that persons with normal liv ers may have slightly elevated levels of ALT This is anormal finding Michael V Zuck PhD Alanine aminotransferase test seeLiver function tests AlbersSchnberg disease see Osteopetroses Albinism Definition Albinism is an inherited condition present at birth characterized by a lack of pigment that normally givescolor to the skin hair and eyes Many types of albinismexist all of which involve lack of pigment in varyingdegrees The condition which is found in all races maybe accompanied by eye problems and may lead to skincancer later in life Description Albinism is a rare disorder found in fewer than five people per in the United States and EuropeOther parts of the world have a much higher rate forexample albinism is found in about out of every people in southern Nigeria There are types of the most common form of the condition known as oculocutaneous albinism whichaffects the eyes hair and skin In its most severe formhair and skin remain pure white throughout life Peoplewith a less severe form are born with white hair andskin which turn slightly darker as they age Everyonewith oculocutaneous albinism experiences abnormalflickering eye movements nystagmus and sensitivity to bright light There may be other eye problems aswell including poor vision and crossed or lazy eyesstrabismus The second most common type of the condition is known as ocular albinism in which only the eyes lackcolor skin and hair are normal There are five forms ofocular albinism some types cause more problemsespecially eye problemsthan others GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AlbinismGEM to A PM Page Causes and symptoms Every cell in the body contains a matched pair of genes one inherited from each parent These genes act as asort of blueprint that guides the development of a fetus Albinism is an inherited problem caused by a flaw in one or more of the genes that are responsible for directing the eyes and skin to make melanin pigment As aresult little or no pigment is made and the childs skineyes and hair may be colorless In most types of albinism a recessive trait the child inherits flawed genes for making melanin from both parents Because the task of making melanin is complexthere are many different types of albinism involving anumber of different genes Its also possible to inherit one normal gene and one albinism gene In this case the one normal gene providesenough information in its cellular blueprint to makesome pigment and the child will have normal skin andeye color They carry one gene for albinism About onein people are albinism carriers with one flawed genebut no symptoms they have a chance of passing thealbinism gene to their child However if both parents areKEY TERMS Amino acids Natural substances that are the building blocks of protein The body breaks downthe protein in food into amino acids and then usesthese amino acids to create other proteins The bodyalso changes amino acids into melanin pigment Astigmatism An eye condition in which the lens doesnt focus light evenly on the retina leading toproblems with visual sharpness Carrier A person with one normal gene and one faulty gene who can pass on a condition to otherswithout actually having symptoms DNA The abbreviation for deoxyribonucleic acid the primary carrier of genetic informationfound in the chromosomes of almost all organismsThe entwined double structure allows the chromosomes to be copied exactly during cell division DOPA The common name for a natural chemical dihydroxyphenylalanine made by the bodyduring the process of making melanin Enzyme A protein that helps the body convert one chemical substance to anotherGene The basic unit of genetic material carried in a particular place on a chromosome Genes arepassed on from parents to child when the spermand egg unite during conception Hairbulb The root of a strand of hair from which the color develops HermanskyPudlak Syndrome HPS A rare type of albinism characterized by a problem with bloodclotting and a buildup of waxy material in lungsand intestines Melanin Pigment made in the hair skin and eyes Nystagmus An involuntary backandforth move ment of the eyes that is often found in albinism Strabismus Crossed or lazy eyes often found in albinism Tyrosine A protein building block found in a wide variety of foods that is used by the body to makemelanin Tyrosinase An enzyme in a pigment cell which helps change tyrosine to DOPA during the processof making melanin carriers with one flawed gene each they have a in chance of passing on both copies of the flawed gene tothe child who will have albinism There is also a type ofocular albinism that is carried on the X chromosome andoccurs almost exclusively in males because they haveonly one X chromosome and therefore no other gene forthe trait to override the flawed one Symptoms of albinism can involve the skin hair and eyes The skin because it contains little pigmentappears very light as does the hair Although people with albinism may experience a vari ety of eye problems one of the myths about albinism is thatit causes people to have pink or red eyes In fact peoplewith albinism can have irises varying from light gray orblue to brown The iris is the colored portion of the eyethat controls the size of the pupil the opening that lets lightinto the eye If people with albinism seem to have reddisheyes its because light is being reflected from the back ofthe eye retina in much the same way as happens whenpeople are photographed with an electronic flash People with albinism may have one or more of the following eye problems GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AlbinismGEM to A PM Page They may be very farsighted or nearsighted and may have other defects in the curvature of the lens of the eyeastigmatism that cause images to appear unfocused They may have a constant involuntary movement of the eyeball called nystagmus They may have problems in coordinating the eyes in fix ing and tracking objects strabismus which may lead toan appearance of having crossed eyes at times Strabismus may cause some problems with depth perception especially at close distances They may be very sensitive to light photophobia because their irises allow stray light to enter their eyesIts a common misconception that people with albinismshouldnt go out on sunny days but wearing sunglassescan make it possible to go outside quite comfortably In addition to the characteristically light skin and eye problems people with a rare form of albinism calledHermanskyPudlak Syndrome HPS also have a greatertendency to have bleeding disorders inflammation of thelarge bowel colitis lung pulmonary disease and kidney renal problemsDiagnosis Its not always easy to diagnose the exact type of albinism a person has there are two tests available thatcan identify only two types of the condition Recently ablood test has been developed that can identify carriersof the gene for some types of albinism a similar test during amniocentesis can diagnose some types of albinism in an unborn child A chorionic villus sampling test dur ing the fifth week of pregnancy may also reveal some types of albinism The specific type of albinism a person has can be determined by taking a good family history and examining the patient and several close relatives The hairbulb pigmentation test is used to identify carriers by incubating a piece of the persons hair in asolution of tyrosine a substance in food which the bodyuses to make melanin If the hair turns dark it means thehair is making melanin a positive test light hairmeans there is no melanin This test is the source of thenames of two types of albinism typos and tyneg The tyrosinase test is more precise than the hairbulb pigmentation test It measures the rate at which hair con GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Albinism A man with albinism stands with his normally pigmented father Photograph by Norman Lightfoot Photo Researchers Inc Reproduced by permissionGEM to A PM Page verts tyrosine into another chemical DOPA which is then made into pigment The hair converts tyrosine withthe help of a substance called tyrosinase In some typesof albinism tyrosinase doesnt do its job and melaninproduction breaks down Treatment There is no treatment that can replace the lack of melanin that causes the symptoms of albinism Doctorscan only treat not cure the eye problems that oftenaccompany the lack of skin color Glasses are usuallyneeded and can be tinted to ease pain from too much sunlight There is no cure for involuntary eye movementsnystagmus and treatments for focusing problemssurgery or contact lenses are not

direct toxic effects on nerve and muscle cells Depending on whichnerve and muscle pathways are involved alcohol canhave farreaching effects on different parts of the brainperipheral nerves and muscles with symptoms of memory loss incoordination seizures weakness and sensory deficits These different effects can be grouped inthree main categories intoxication due to the acuteeffects of ethanol

AlbinismGEM to A PM Page patient with longterm alcohol abuse may have no neu rologic complications a single alcoholrelated diseaseor multiple conditions depending on the genes theyhave inherited how well nourished they are and otherenvironmental factors such as exposure to other drugsor toxins Neurologic complications of alcohol abuse may also result from nutritional deficiency because alcoholicstend to eat poorly and may become depleted of thiamineor other vitamins important for nervous system function Persons who are intoxicated are also at higher risk forhead injury or for compression injuries of the peripheral nerves Sudden changes in blood chemistry especiallysodium related to alcohol abuse may cause central pontine myelinolysis a condition of the brainstem in whichnerves lose their myelin coating Liver disease complicating alcoholic cirrhosis may cause dementia deliri um and movement disorder Causes and symptoms When a person drinks alcohol it is absorbed by blood vessels in the stomach lining and flows rapidlythroughout the body and brain as ethanol freely crossesthe bloodbrain barrier that ordinarily keeps large molecules from escaping from the blood vessel to the braintissue Drunkenness or intoxication may occur at bloodethanol concentrations of as low as mg per dL inpeople who dont drink Sleepiness stupor coma o r even death from respiratory depression and low bloodpressure occur at progressively higher concentrations Although alcohol is broken down by the liver the toxic effects from a high dose of alcohol are most likely adirect result of alcohol itself rather than of its breakdownproducts The fatal dose varies widely because peoplewho drink heavily develop a tolerance to the effects ofalcohol with repeated use In addition alcohol toleranceresults in the need for higher levels of blood alcohol toachieve intoxicating effects which increases the likelihood that habitual drinkers will be exposed to high andpotentially toxic levels of ethanol This is particularlytrue when binge drinkers fail to eat because fasting decreases the rate of alcohol clearance and causes evenhigher blood alcohol levels When a chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking withdrawal of alcohol leads to a syndrome of increasedexcitability of the central nervous system called delirium tremens or DTs Symptoms begin six to eighthours after abstinence and are most pronounced hours after abstinence They include body shakingtremulousness insomnia agitation confusion hear ing voices or seeing images that are not really theresuch as crawling bugs seizures rapid heart beat profuse sweating high blood pressure and fever Alcohol related seizures may also occur without withdrawalsuch as during active heavy drinking or after more than aweek without alcohol WernickeKorsakoff syndrome is caused by defi ciency of the Bvitamin thiamine and can also be seen inpeople who dont drink but have some other cause of thiamine deficiency such as chronic vomiting that preventsthe absorption of this vitamin Patients with this condition have the sudden onset of Wernicke encephalopathythe symptoms include marked confusion delirium disorientation inattention memory loss and drowsinessExamination reveals abnormalities of eye movementincluding jerking of the eyes nystagmus and double vision Problems with balance make walking difficultPeople may have trouble coordinating their leg movements but usually not their arms If thiamine is not givenpromptly Wernicke encephalopathy may progress to stupor coma and death If thiamine is given and death averted Korsakoffs syndrome may develop in some patients who suffer from memory impairment that leaves them unable toremember events for a period of a few years before theonset of illness retrograde amnesia and unable to learn new information anterograde amnesia Most patientshave very limited insight into their memory dysfunctionand have a tendency to make up explanations for eventsthey have forgotten

myoglobinuria Males areaffected by acute sudden onset alcoholic myopathyfour times as often as females Breakdown of muscle tissue myonecrosis can come on suddenly during bingedrinking or in the first days of alcohol withdrawal In itsmildest form this breakdown may cause no noticeable GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Alcoholrelated neurologic diseaseGEM to A PM Page symptoms but may be detected by a temporary elevation in blood levels of an enzyme found predominantly inmuscle the MM fraction of creatine kinase The severe form of acute alcoholic myopathy is associated with the sudden onset of muscle pain swelling and weakness a reddish tinge in the urinecaused by myoglobin a breakdown product of muscleexcreted in the urine and a rapid rise in muscle enzymesin the blood Symptoms usually worsen over hours to afew days and then improve over the next week to days as the patient is withdrawn from alcohol Musclesymptoms are usually generalized but pain and swellingmay selectively involve the calves or other musclegroups The muscle breakdown of acute alcoholicmyopathy may be worsened by crush injuries whichmay occur when people drink so much that they compress a muscle group with their body weight for a longtime without moving or by withdrawal seizures withgeneralized muscle activity In patients who abuse alcohol over many years chronic alcoholic myopathy may develop Males andfemales are equally affected Symptoms include painless weakness of the limb muscles closest to the trunkand the girdle muscles including the thighs hipsshoulders and upper arms This weakness developsgradually over weeks or months without symptoms ofacute muscle injury Muscle atrophy or decreased bulkmay be striking The nerves of the extremities may alsobegin to break down a condition known as alcoholicperipheral neuropathy which can add to the persons difficulty in moving The way in which alcohol destroys muscle tissue is still not well understood Proposed mechanisms includemuscle membrane changes affecting the transport of calcium potassium or other minerals impaired muscle energy metabolism and impaired protein synthesisAlcohol is metabolized or broken down primarily by theliver with a series of chemical reactions in which ethanolis converted to acetate Acetate is metabolized by skeletalmuscle and alcoholrelated changes in liver functionmay affect skeletal muscle metabolism decreasing theamount of blood sugar available to muscles during prolonged activity Because not enough sugar is available tosupply needed energy muscle protein may be brokendown as an alternate energy source However toxiceffects on muscle may be a direct result of alcohol itselfrather than of its breakdown products Although alcoholic peripheral neuropathy may con tribute to muscle weakness and atrophy by injuring themotor nerves controlling muscle movement alcoholicneuropathy more commonly affects sensory fibersInjury to these fibers can cause tingling or burning painin the feet which may be severe enough to interfere with walking As the condition worsens pain decreases butnumbness increases Diagnosis The diagnosis of alcoholrelated neurologic disease depends largely on finding characteristic symptoms andsigns in patients who abuse alcohol Other possiblecauses should be excluded by the appropriate testswhich may include blood chemistry thyroid function tests brain MRI magnetic resonance imaging or CT computed tomography scan andor cerebrospinalfluid analysis Acute alcoholic myopathy can be diagnosed by finding myoglobin in the urine and increased creatinekinase and other blood enzymes released from injuredmuscle The surgical removal of a small piece of musclefor microscopic analysis muscle biopsy shows thescattered breakdown and repair of muscle fibers Doctors must rule out other acquired causes of musclebreakdown which include the abuse of drugs such asheroin cocaine or amphetamines trauma with crush injury the depletion of phosphate or potassium or anunderlying defect in the metabolism of carbohydrates orlipids In chronic alcoholic myopathy serum creatinekinase often is normal and muscle biopsy shows atrophy or loss of muscle fibers Electromyography EMG may show features characteristic of alcoholicmyopathy or neuropathy Treatment Acute management of alcohol intoxication delirium tremens and withdrawal is primarily supportive to monitor and treat any cardiovascular or respiratory failure that may develop In delirium tremens fever and sweating may necessitate treatment of fluid loss and secondarylow blood pressure Agitation

Definition The essential feature of alcohol abuse is the mal adaptive use of alcohol with recurrent and significantadverse consequences related to its repeated use Alcoholism is the popular term for two disorders alcoholabuse and alcohol dependence The hallmarks of boththese disorders involve repeated life problems that can bedirectly attributed to the use of alcohol Both these disorders can have serious consequences affecting an individuals health and personal life as well as having an impacton society at large Description The effects of alcoholism are quite farreaching Alcohol affects every body system causing a wide rangeof health problems Some such problems include poornutrition memory disorders difficulty with balance and walking liver disease including cirrhosis and hepatitis high blood pressure muscle weakness including theheart heart rhythm disturbances anemia clotting disorders decreased immunity to infections gastrointestinalinflammation and irritation acute and chronic problemswith the pancreas low blood sugar high blood fat content interference with reproductive fertility and weakened bones On a personal level alcoholism results in marital and other relationship difficulties depression unemployment child abuse and general family dysfunction Alcoholism causes or contributes to a variety of severe social problems including homelessness murdersuicide injury and violent crime Alcohol is a contributing factor in at least of all deaths from motor vehicle accidents In fact about deaths occur eachyear due to the effects of alcohol of which are dueto injuries of some sort According to a recent specialreport prepared for the US Congress by the NationalInstitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism the impactof alcohol on society including violence traffic accidents lost work productivity and premature death costs our nation an estimated billion annually In addition it is estimated that approximately one in four children million children or percent of children up to years of age is exposed at some time to familial alcohol abuse alcohol dependence or both Furthermore ithas been estimated that approximately percent ofadults experience an episode of alcohol abuse or dependence a some time during their lives Causes and symptoms There are probably a number of factors that work together to cause a person to become an alcoholicRecent genetic studies have demonstrated that close relatives of an alcoholic are four times more likely tobecome alcoholics themselves Furthermore this riskholds true even for children who were adopted awayfrom their biological families at birth and raised in anonalcoholic adoptive family with no knowledge oftheir biological familys difficulties with alcohol Moreresearch is being conducted to determine if genetic factors could account for differences in alcohol metabolism that may increase the risk of an individual becoming an alcoholic The symptoms of alcoholism can be broken down into two major categories symptoms of acute alcoholuse and symptoms of longterm alcohol use Immediate acute effects of alcohol use Alcohol exerts a depressive effect on the brain The bloodbrain barrier does not prevent alcohol from entering the brain so the brain alcohol level will quicklybecome equivalent to the blood alcohol level Alcoholsdepressive effects result in difficulty walking poor balance slurring of speech and generally poor coordination GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AlcoholismGEM to A PM Page accounting in part for the increased likelihood of injury The affected person may also have impairment ofperiperal vision At higher alcohol levels a personsbreathing and heart rates will be slowed and vomitingmay occur with a high risk of the vomit being breathedinto the lungs resulting in severe problems including thepossibility of pneumonia Still higher alcohol levels may result in coma and death Effects of longterm chronic alcoholism Longterm use of alcohol affects virtually every organ system of the body Nervous system An estimated of all men in their teens and twenties have experienced alcoholicblackout which occurs when drinking a large quantityof alcohol results in the loss of memory of the timesurrounding the episode of drinking Alcohol is wellknown to cause sleep disturbances so that overallsleep quality is affected Numbness and tingling may occur in the arms and legs Two syndromes which canoccur together or separately are known as Wernickesand Korsakoffs syndromes Both are due to the lowthiamine a form of vitamin B complex levels foundin alcoholics Wernickes syndrome results in disordered eye movements very poor balance and difficultywalking while Korsakoffs syndrome severely affects ones memory preventing new learning fromtaking place Gastrointestinal system Alcohol causes loosening of the muscular ring that prevents the stomachs contentsfrom reentering the esophagus Therefore the acidfrom the stomach flows backwards into the esophagus burning those tissues and causing pain and bleeding Inflammation of the stomach can also resultin bleeding and pain and decreased desire to eat Amajor cause of severe uncontrollable bleeding hemorrhage in an alcoholic is the development ofenlarged dilated blood vessels within the esophaguswhich are called esophageal varices These varices areactually developed in response to liver disease andare extremely prone to bursting and hemorrhagingDiarrhea is a common symptom due to alcohols effect on the pancreas In addition inflammation ofthe pancreas pancreatitis is a serious and painful problem in alcoholics Throughout the intestinal tractalcohol interferes with the absorption of nutrientscreating a malnourished state Because alcohol is broken down metabolized within the liver that organ isseverely affected by constant levels of alcohol Alcohol interferes with a number of important chemicalprocesses that also occur in the liver The liver beginsto enlarge and fill with fat fatty liver fibrous scartissue interferes with the livers normal structure and function cirrhosis and the liver may becomeinflamed hepatitis Blood Alcohol can cause changes to all the types of blood cells Red blood cells become abnormallylarge White blood cells important for fighting infections decrease in number resulting in a weakenedimmune system This places alcoholics at increasedrisk for infections and is thought to account in partfor the increased risk of cancer faced by alcoholics ten times increased over normal Platelets and bloodclotting factors are affected causing an increased riskof bleeding Heart Small amounts of alcohol cause a drop in blood pressure but with increased use alcohol begins toincrease blood pressure into a dangerous range Highlevels of fats circulating in the bloodstream increase therisk of heart disease Heavy drinking results in anincrease in heart size weakening of the heart muscleabnormal heart rhythms a risk of blood clots formingwithin the chambers of the heart and a greatlyincreased risk of stroke due to a blood clot from the heart entering the circulatory system going to thebrain and blocking a brain blood vessel Reproductive system Heavy drinking has a negative effect on fertility in both men and women by decreasing testicle and ovary size and interfering with bothsperm and egg production When pregnancy is achieved in an alcoholic woman the baby has a greatrisk of being born with fetal alcohol syndrome which causes distinctive facial defects lowered IQ andbehavioral problems Diagnosis Two different types of alcoholrelated difficulties have been identified The first is called alcohol depen dence which refers to a person who literally depends on the use of alcohol Three of the following traits must bepresent to diagnose alcohol dependence tolerance meaning that a person becomes accustomed to a particular dose of alcohol and must increase thedose in order to obtain the desired effect withdrawal meaning that a person experiences unpleasant physical and psychological symptoms whenhe or she does not drink alcohol the tendency to drink more alcohol than one intends once an alcoholic starts to drink he or she finds it difficult to stop being unable to avoid drinking or stop drinking once started GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AlcoholismGEM to A PM Page having large blocks of time taken up by alcohol use choosing to drink at the expense of other important tasks or activities drinking despite evidence of negative effects on ones health relationships education or job Alcohol abuse requires that one of the following four criteria is met Because of drinking a person repeatedly fails to live up to his or her most important responsibili ties physically endangers him or herself or others for example by drinking when driving gets into trouble with the law experiences difficulties in relationships or jobs Diagnosis is sometimes brought about when family members call an alcoholics difficulties to the attentionof a physician A clinician may begin to be suspiciouswhen a patient suffers repeated injuries or begins toexperience medical problems related to the use of alcohol In fact some estimates suggest that about of aphysicians patients will be alcoholics Diagnosis is aided by administering specific psycho logical assessments that try to determine what aspects ofa persons life may be affected by his or her use of alcohol Determining the exact quantity of alcohol that a person drinks is of much less importance than determininghow his or her drinking affects relationships jobs educational goals and family life In fact because the metabolism of alcohol how the body breaks down and processes alcohol is so individual the quantity of alcohol consumed is not part of the criteria list for diagnosing eitheralcohol dependence or alcohol abuse One very simple tool for beginning the diagnosis of alcoholism is called the CAGE questionnaire It consistsof four questions with the first letters of each key wordspelling out the word CAGE Have you ever tried to Cutdown on your drinking Have you ever been Annoyed by anyones comments about your drinking Have you ever felt Guilty about your drinking Do you ever need an Eyeopener a morning drink of alcohol to start the day Other longer lists of questions exist to help deter mine the severity and effects of a persons alcohol useGiven the recent research pointing to a genetic basisfor alcoholism it is important to ascertain whetheranyone else in the persons family has ever sufferedfrom alcoholism Physical examination may reveal signs suggestive of alcoholism evidence of old injuries a visible networkof enlarged veins just under the skin around the navelcalled caput medusae fluid in the abdomen ascites yellowishtone to the skin decreased testicular size inmen and poor nutritional status Lab work may reveal anincrease in the size of the red blood cells abnormalitiesin the white blood cells cells responsible for fightinginfection and platelets particles responsible for clotting and an increase in certain liver enzymes Treatment Treatment of alcoholism has two parts The first step in the treatment of alcoholism called detoxification involves helping the person stop drinking and ridding hisor her body of the harmful toxic effects of alcoholBecause the persons body has become accustomed toalcohol the person will need to be supported throughwithdrawal Withdrawal will be different for differentpatients depending on the severity of the alcoholism asmeasured by the quantity of alcohol ingested daily and thelength of time the patient has been an alcoholic Withdrawal symptoms can range from mild to lifethreateningMild withdrawal symptoms include nausea achiness diarrhea difficulty sleeping sweatiness anxiety and trem bling This phase is usually over in about three to fivedays More severe effects of withdrawal can include hallu cinations in which a patient sees hears or feels some thing that is not actually real seizures an unbearablecraving for more alcohol confusion fever fast heart rate high blood pressure and delirium a fluctuating level of consciousness Patients at highest risk for the most severesymptoms of withdrawal referred to as delirium tremensare those with other medical problems including malnu trition liver disease or Wernickes syndrome Delirium GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF

usually begin about three to five days after the patients last drink progressing from the more mild symptoms to the more severe and may last a number of days Patients going through only mild withdrawal are sim ply monitored carefully to make sure that more severesymptoms do not develop No medications are necessaryhowever Treatment of a patient suffering the more severeeffects of withdrawal may require the use of sedative medications to relieve the discomfort of withdrawal and toavoid the potentially lifethreatening complications of highblood pressure fast heart rate and seizures Drugs calledbenzodiazapines are helpful in those patients sufferingfrom hallucinations Because of the patients nausea fluidsmay need to be given through a vein intravenously alongwith some necessary sugars and salts It is crucial that thiamine be included in the fluids because thiamine is usuallyquite low in alcoholic patients and deficiency of thiamineis responsible for the WernickeKorsakoff syndrome After cessation of drinking has been accomplished the next steps involve helping the patient avoid ever taking another drink This phase of treatment is referred toas rehabilitation The best programs incorporate the family into the therapy because the family has undoubtedly been severely affected by the patients drinkingSome therapists believe that family members in an effortto deal with their loved ones drinking problem sometimes develop patterns of behavior that accidentally support or enable the patients drinking This situation isreferred to as codependence and must be addressed inorder to successfully treat a persons alcoholism Sessions led by peers where recovering alcoholics meet regularly and provide support for each othersrecoveries are considered some of the best methods ofpreventing a return to drinking relapse Perhaps themost wellknown such group is called AlcoholicsAnonymous which uses a step model to help people avoid drinking These steps involve recognizing thedestructive power that alcohol has held over the alcoholics life looking to a higher power for help in overcoming the problem and reflecting on the ways inwhich the use of alcohol has hurt others and if possible making amends to those people According to arecent study reported by the American PsychologicalAssociation APA anyone regardless of his or herreligious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs can benefitfrom participation in step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous AA or Narcotics AnonymousNA The number of visits to step selfhelp groupsexceeds the number of visits to all mental health professionals combined There are also medications that may help an alco holic avoid returning to drinking These have been usedwith variable success Disulfiram Antabuse is a drug which when mixed with alcohol causes unpleasant reactions including nausea vomiting diarrhea and tremblingNaltrexone along with a similar compound Nalmefenecan be helpful in limiting the effects of a relapse Acamprosate is helpful in preventing relapse None of thesemedications would be helpful unless the patient was alsowilling to work very hard to change his or her behavior Alternative treatment Alternative treatments can be a helpful adjunct for the alcoholic patient once the medical danger of withdrawalhas passed Because many alcoholics have very stressfullives whether because of or leading to the alcoholism issometimes a matter of debate many of the treatments foralcoholism involve dealing with and relieving stress These include massage meditation and hypnotherapy The malnutrition of longterm alcohol use is addressed by nutritionoriented practitioners with careful attention to ahealthy diet and the use of nutritional supplements such asvitamins A B complex and C as well as certain fatty acids amino acids zinc magnesium and selenium Herbaltreatments include milk thistle Silybum marianum which is thought to protect the liver against damage Other herbsare thought to be helpful for the patient suffering throughwithdrawal Some of these include lavender Lavandula officinalis skullcap Scutellaria lateriflora chamomile Matricaria recutita peppermint Mentha piperita yarrow Achillea millefolium and valerian Valeriana officinalis Acupuncture is believed to both decrease withdrawal symptoms and to help improve a patientschances for continued recovery from alcoholism Prognosis Recovery from alcoholism is a lifelong process In fact people who have suffered from alcoholism are encouraged to refer to themselves ever after as a recovering alcoholic never a recovered alcoholic This is because mostresearchers in the field believe that since the potential foralcoholism is still part of the individuals biological andpsychological makeup one can never fully recover fromalcoholism The potential for relapse returning to illnessis always there and must be acknowledged and respectedStatistics suggest that among middleclass alcoholics instable financial and family situations who have undergonetreatment or more can be successful at an attempt tostop drinking for at least a year and many for a lifetime Prevention Prevention must begin at a relatively young age

throughout the body particularly in muscles Like all enzymes it is needed totrigger specific chemical reactions Aldolase helps muscle turn sugar into energy Testing for aldolase is done todiagnose and monitor skeletal muscle diseases Purpose Skeletal muscle diseases increase the aldolase level found in a persons blood Skeletal muscles are thosemuscles attached to bones and whose contractions makethose bones move When the muscles are diseased ordamaged such as in muscular dystrophy the cells dete riorate and break open The contents of the cells including aldolase spill into the bloodstream Measuring theamount of aldolase in the blood indicates the degree ofmuscle damage As muscles continue to deteriorate aldolase levels decrease and eventually fall below normal Less musclemeans fewer cells and less aldolase Muscle weakness may be caused by neurologic as well as muscular problems The measurement of aldolaselevels can help pinpoint the cause Aldolase levels will benormal where muscle weakness is caused by neurological disease such as poliomyelitis or multiple sclerosis but aldolase levels will be elevated in cases of musculardisease such as muscular dystrophy GALE

chemical reactions Neurologic Having to do with the nervous sys tem Skeletal muscle Muscle connected to and nec essary for the movement of bonesAldolase is also found in the liver and cardiac mus cle of the heart Damage or disease to these organs suchas chronic hepatitis or a heart attack will also increase aldolase levels in the blood but to a lesser degree Description Aldolase is measured by mixing a persons serum with a substance with which aldolase is known to triggera reaction The end product of this reaction is measuredand from that measurement the amount of aldolase inthe persons serum is determined The test is covered by insurance when medically necessary Results are usually available the next day Preparation To collect the ml of blood needed for this test a healthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the patients upperarm locates a vein in the inner elbow region and insertsa needle into that vein Vacuum action draws the bloodthrough the needle into an attached tube Collection ofthe sample takes only a few minutes The patient should avoid strenuous exercise and have nothing to eat or drink except water for eight to tenhours before this test Aftercare Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture site and the person may feel dizzy or faint Pressure tothe puncture site until the bleeding stops will reducebruising Warm packs to the puncture site will relievediscomfort Normal results Newborns have the highest normal aldolase levels and adults the lowest Normal values will vary based onthe laboratory and the method used Abnormal results As noted aldolase is elevated in skeletal muscle dis eases such as muscular dystrophies Duchennes muscular dystrophy the most common type of muscular dystrophy will increase the aldolase level more than any otherdisease Nondisease conditions that affect the muscle such as injury gangrene or an infection can also increase the aldolase level Also strenuous exercise can temporarilyincrease a persons aldolase levelCertain

the twoadrenal glands organs which sit one on top of each ofthe kidneys Aldosterone regulates the amounts of sodium and potassium in the blood This helps maintainwater balance and blood volume which in turn affectsblood pressure Purpose Aldosterone measurement is useful in detecting a condition called aldosteronism which is caused byexcess secretion of the hormone from the adrenal glands GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Aldosterone assayGEM to A PM Page There are two types of aldosteronism primary and sec ondary Primary aldosteronism is most commonly causedby an adrenal tumor as in Conns

in the abdominal cavity ascites certain kidney diseases excess potassium sodiumdepleted diet and toxemia of pregnancy To differentiate primary aldosteronism from sec ondary aldosteronism a plasma renin test should be performed at the same time as the aldosterone assay Reninan enzyme produced in the kidneys is high in secondaryaldosteronism and low in primary aldosteronism Description Aldosterone testing can be performed on a blood sample or on a hour urine specimen Several factorsincluding diet posture upright or lying down and timeof day that the sample is obtained can cause aldosteronelevels to fluctuate Blood samples are affected by shortterm fluctuations A urine specimen collected over anentire hour period lessens the effects of those interfering factors and provides a

atleast two weeks before either test The doctor shoulddecide if drugs that alter sodium potassium and fluidbalance eg diuretics antihypertensives steroids oral contraceptives should be withheld The test will be more accurate if these are suspended at least two weeksbefore the test Renin inhibitors eg propranololshould not be taken one week before the test unless permitted by the physician The

sold as Campath in the United States Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to CD a protein found onthe surface of normal and malignant B and T cells that isused to reduce the numbers of circulating malignant cellsof patients who have Bcell chronic lymphocyticleukemia BCLL Purpose Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat BCLL one of the most prevalent forms of adult chronicleukemia It specifically binds CD a protein found onthe surface of essentially all B and T cells of the immunesystem By binding the CD protein on the malignant Bcells the antibody targets it for removal from the circulation Scientists believe that alemtuzumab triggers antibodymediated lysis of the B cells a method that theimmune system uses to eliminate foreign cells Alemtuzumab has been approved by the FDA for treatment of refractory BCLL For a patients disease tobe classified as refractory both alkylating agents and fludarabine treatment must have been tried and failed Thusthis drug gives patients who have tried all approved treatments for BCLL another option As most patients withBCLL are in stage III or IV by the time both alkylatingagents and fludarabine have been tried the experiencewith alemtuzumab treatment are primarily with thosestages of the disease In clinical trials about ofpatients had a partial response to the drug with ofthese being complete responses This antibody has been tested with limited success in the treatment of nonHodgkins lymphoma NHL andfor the preparation of patients with various immune cellmalignancies for bone marrow transplantation There isalso a clinical trial ongoing to test the ability of this antibody to prevent rejection in kidney transplantation Description Alemtuzumab is produced in the laboratory using genetically engineered single clones of Bcells Like allantibodies it is a Yshaped molecule can bind one particular substance the antigen for that monoclonal antibodyFor alemtuzumab the antigen is CD a protein foundon the surface of normal and malignant B and T cells aswell as other cells of the immune and male reproductivesystems Alemtuzumab is a humanized antibody meaning that the regions that bind CD located on the tips ofthe Y branches are derived from rat antibodies but therest of the antibody is human sequence The presence ofthe human sequences helps to reduce the immuneresponse by the patient against the antibody itself aproblem seen when complete mouse antibodies are usedfor cancer therapies The human sequences also help toensure that the various celldestroying mechanisms ofthe human immune system are properly triggered withbinding of the antibody Alemtuzumab was approved in May of for the treatment of refractory BCLL It is approved for usealone but clinical trials have tested the ability of the antibody to be used in combination with the purine analogspentostatin fludarabine and cladribine and rituximab amonoclonal antibody specific for the CD antigenanother protein found on the surface of B cells Recommended dosage This antibody should be administered in a gradually escalating pattern at the start of treatment and any timeadministration is interrupted for seven or more days Therecommended beginning dosage for BCLL patients is adaily dose of mg of Campath administered as a twohour IV infusion Once this amount is tolerated the doseis increased to mg per day After tolerating this doseit can be increased to mg administered three days aweek Acetominophen and diphenhydramine hydrochoride are given thirty to sixty minutes before the infusion to help reduce side effects Additionally patients generally receive antiinfec tive medication before treatment to help minimize theserious opportunistic infections that can result from thistreatment Specifically trimethoprimsulfamethoxazoleto prevent bacterial infections and famciclovir to prevent viral infections were used during the clinical trial todecrease infections although they were not eliminated Precautions Blood studies should be done on a weekly basis while patients are receiving the alemtuzumab treatment Vaccination during the treatment session is notrecommended given the T cell depletion that occursduring treatment Furthermore given that antibodieslike alumtuzumab can pass through the placenta to thedeveloping fetus and in breast milk use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended unlessclearly needed Side effects A severe side effect of alemtuzumab treatment is the possible depletion of one or more types of blood cells GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AlemtuzumabGEM to A PM Page Because CD is expressed on a patients normal B and T cells as well as on the surface of the abnormal B cellsthe treatment eliminates both normal and cancerouscells The treatment also seems to trigger autoimmunereactions against various other blood cells This results insevere reduction of the many circulating blood cellsincluding red blood cells anemia white blood cellsneutropenia and clotting cells thrombopenia Theseconditions are treated with blood transfusions The greatmajority of patients treated exhibit some type of bloodcell depletion A second serious side effect of this drug is the preva lence of opportunistic infections that occurs during thetreatment Serious and sometimes fatal bacterial viralfungal and protozoan infections have been reportedTreatments to prevent pneumonia and herpes infectionsreduce but do not eliminate these infections The majority of other side effects occur after or dur ing the first infusion of the drug Some

and expression to the body andclear thinking to the mind Purpose Because the Alexander technique helps students improve overall functioning both mental and physical itoffers a wide range of benefits Nikolaas Tinbergen in his Nobel lecture hailed the striking improvements insuch diverse things as high blood pressure breathingdepth of sleep overall cheerfulness and mental alertnessresilience against outside pressures and the refined skillof playing a musical instrument He went on to quote alist of other conditions helped by the Alexander technique rheumatism including various forms of

rehabilitative exercises improvements in strain caused bycomputer use improvements in the posture and performance of school children and improvements in vocal anddramatic performance among the benefits offered by thetechnique Description Origins Frederick Matthias Alexander was born in in Tasmania Australia He became an actor and Shakespearean reciter and early in his career he began to sufferfrom strain on his vocal chords He sought medical attention for chronic hoarseness but after treatment with arecommended prescription and extensive periods of resthis problem persisted Alexander realized that his hoarseness began about an hour into a dramatic performance and reasoned that itwas something he did in the process of reciting thatcaused him to lose his voice Returning to his medicaldoctor Alexander told him of his observation When thedoctor admitted that he didnt know what Alexander wasdoing to injure his vocal chords Alexander decided to tryand find out for himself Thus began a decade of selfobservation and discov ery Using as many as three mirrors to observe himself inthe act of reciting normal speaking and later standingwalking and sitting Alexander managed to improve hiscoordination and to overcome his vocal problems One ofhis most startling discoveries was that in order to changethe way he used his body he had to change the way hewas thinking redirecting his thoughts in such a way thathe did not produce unnecessary tension when he attempted speech or movement After making this discovery atthe end of the nineteenth century Alexander became apioneer in bodymind medicine At first performers and dancers sought guidance from Alexander to overcome physical complaints andto improve the expression and spontaneity of theirperformances Soon a great number of people soughthelp from his teaching for a variety of physical andmental disorders The Alexander technique is primarily taught one onone in private lessons Introductory workshops orworkshops for special applications of the techniqueegworkshops for musicians are also common Private lessons range from a halfhour to an hour in lengthand are taught in a series The number of lessons variesaccording to the severity of the students difficultieswith coordination or to the extent of the students interest in pursuing the improvements made possible by con tinued study The cost of lessons ranges from perhour Insurance coverage is not widely available butdiscounts are available for participants in some complementary care insurance plans Pretax Flexible SpendingAccounts for health care cover Alexander techniquelessons if they are prescribed by a physician In lessons teachers guide students through simple movements while students are dressed in comfortableclothing and use their hands to help students identifyand stop destructive patterns of tension Tensing arisesfrom mental processes as well as physical so discussionsof personal reactions or behavior are likely to arise in thecourse of a lesson The technique helps students move with ease and improved coordination At the beginning of a movement the lessons are a series of movements mostpeople pull back their heads raise their shoulderstoward their ears overarch their lower backs tightentheir legs and otherwise produce excessive tension intheir bodies Alexander referred to this as misuse ofthe body At any point in a movement proper use can be established If the neck muscles are not overtensed thehead will carry slightly forward of the spine simplybecause it is heavier in the front When the head is out ofbalance in the forward direction it sets off a series ofstretch reflexes in the extensor muscles of the back It isskillful use of these reflexes along with reflex activity inthe feet and legs the arms and hands the breathingmechanism and other parts of the body that lessons inthe technique aim to develop Alexander found that optimal functioning of the body was very hard to maintain even for the short periodof time it took to complete a single movement Peopleespecially adults have very strong tension habits associated with movement Chronic misuse of the muscles iscommon It may be caused by slouching in front of televisions or video monitors too much sitting or drivingand too little walking or by tension associated with pasttraumas and injuries Stiffening the neck after awhiplash injury or favoring a broken or sprained leg long after it has healed are examples of habitual tensioncaused by injury The first thing a teacher of the Alexander tech nique does is to increase a students sensory awarenessof this excessive habitual tension particularly that inthe neck and spine Next the student is taught to inhibitthe tension If the student prepares to sit down forexample he will tense his muscles in his habitual wayIf he is asked to put aside the intention to sit andinstead to free his neck and allow less constriction in GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Alexander techniqueGEM to A PM Page his muscles he can begin to change his tense habitual response to sitting By leaving the head resting on the spine in its natur al free balance by keeping eyes open and focused notheld in a tense stare by allowing the shoulders to releasethe knees to unlock and the back to lengthen and widena student greatly reduces strain In Alexander lessons students learn to direct themselves this way in activity andbecome skilled in fluid coordinated movement Precautions Side effects The focus of the Alexander technique is educational Teachers use their hands simply to gently guide studentsin movement Therefore both contraindications andpotential physiological side effects are kept to a minimum No forceful treatment of soft tissue or bony structure is attempted so damage to tissues even in the caseof errors in teaching is unlikely As students sensory awareness develops in the course of Alexander lessons they become more acutelyaware of chronic tension patterns As students learn torelease excessive tension in their muscles and to sustainthis release in daily activity they may experience tightness or soreness in the connective tissue This is causedby the connective tissue adapting to the lengthened andreleased muscles and the expanded range of movementin the joints Occasionally students may get lightheaded during a lesson as contracted muscles release and effect the circulatory or respiratory functioning Forceful contraction of muscles and rigid postures often indicate suppression of emotion As musclesrelease during or after an Alexander lesson students mayexperience strong surges of emotion or sudden changesin mood In some cases somatic memories surfacebringing to consciousness past injury or trauma This cancause extreme anxiety and referrals may be made by the teacher for counseling Research and general acceptance Alexander became well known among the intellectu al artistic and medical communities in London England during the

reactions When itis present in large amounts it may signify bone or liverdisease or a tumor Purpose Medical testing of alkaline phosphatase is concerned with the enzyme that is found in liver bone placentaand intestine In a healthy liver fluid containing alkalinephosphate and other substances is continually drainedaway through the bile duct In a diseased liver this bileduct is often blocked keeping fluid within the liverAlkaline phosphatase accumulates and eventuallyescapes into the bloodstream The alkaline phosphatase of the liver is produced by the cells lining the small bile ducts ductoles in the liverIts origin differs from that of other enzymes calledaminotransferases If the liver disease is primarily of anobstructive nature cholestatic ie involving the biliarydrainage system the alkaline phosphatase will be thefirst and foremost enzyme elevation If on the otherhand the disease is primarily of the liver cells hepatocytes the aminotransferases will rise prominentlyThusthese enzymes are very useful in distinguishing the typeof liver diseasecholestatic or hepatocellular Growing bones need alkaline phosphatase Any con dition of bone growth will cause alkaline phosphataselevels to rise The condition may be normal such as achildhood growth spurt or the healing of a broken boneor the condition may be a disease such as bone cancer Pagets disease or rickets During pregnancy alkaline phosphatase is made by the placenta and leaks into the mothers bloodstreamThis is normal Some tumors however start productionof the same kind of alkaline phosphatase produced by theplacenta These tumors are called germ cell tumors andinclude testicular cancer and certain brain tumors Alkaline phosphatase from the intestine is increased in a person with inflammatory bowel disease such asulcerative colitis Description Alkaline phosphatase is measured by combining the persons serum with specific substances with which alkaline phosphatase is known to react The end product ofthis reaction is measured and from that measurementthe amount of alkaline phosphatase in the persons serumis determined Each tissueliver bone placenta and intestine produces a slightly different alkaline phosphatase Thesevariations are called isoenzymes In the laboratory alkaline phosphatase is measured as the total amount or theamount of each of the the four isoenzymes The isoenzymes react differently to heat certain chemicals andother processes in the laboratory Methods to measurethem separately are based on these differences The test is covered by insurance when medically necessary Results are usually available the next day Preparation To collect the ml blood needed for this test a healthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the persons upperarm locates a vein in the inner elbow region and insertsa needle into that vein Vacuum action draws the bloodthrough the needle into an attached tube Collection ofthe sample takes only a few minutes A person being tested for alkaline phosphatase shouldnt have anything to eat or drink except water foreight to ten hours before the test Some people releasealkaline phosphatase from the intestine into the bloodstream after eating This

four major types of infections in humans causedby Aspergillus fungi ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in asthma patients who are allergic to this specific fungus Description ABPA is an allergic reaction to a species of Aspergillus called Aspergillus fumigatus It is sometimes grouped together with other lung disorders characterizedby eosinophiliaan abnormal increase of a certain typeof white blood cell in the bloodunder the heading ofeosinophilic pneumonia These disorders are also called hypersensitivity lung diseases ABPA appears to be increasing in frequency in the United States although the reasons for the increase are notclear The disorder is most likely to occur in adult asthmatics aged It affects males and females equally Causes and symptoms ABPA develops when the patient breathes air con taining Aspergillus spores These spores are found worldwide especially around riverbanks marshes bogsforests and wherever there is wet or decaying vegetationThey are also found on wet paint construction materialsand in air conditioning systems ABPA is a nosocomialinfection which means that a patient can get it in a hospital When Aspergillus spores reach the bronchi which are the branches of the windpipe that lead into the lungsthe bronchi react by contracting spasmodically So thepatient has difficulty breathing and usually wheezes orcoughs Many patients with ABPA also run a lowgradefever and lose their appetites Complications Patients with ABPA sometimes cough up large amounts of blood a condition that is called hemoptysis They may also develop a serious longterm form ofbronchiectasis the formation of fibrous tissue in the lungs Bronchiectasis is a chronic bronchial disorder GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosisGEM to A PM Page caused by repeated inflammation of the airway and marked by the abnormal enlargement of or damage tothe bronchial walls ABPA sometimes occurs as a complication of cystic fibrosis Diagnosis The diagnosis of ABPA is based on a combination of the patients history and the results of blood tests sputumtests skin tests and diagnostic imaging The doctor willbe concerned to distinguish between ABPA and a worsening of the patients asthma cystic fibrosis or otherlung disorders There are seven major criteria for a diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis a history of asthma an accumulation of fluid in the lung that is visible on a chest x ray bronchiectasis abnormal stretching enlarging or destruction of the walls of the bronchial tubes skin reaction to Aspergillus antigen eosinophilia in the patients blood and sputumAspergillus precipitins in the patients blood Precip itins are antibodies that react with the antigen to form asolid that separates from the rest of the solution in thetest tube a high level of IgE in the patients blood IgE refers to a class of antibodies in blood plasma that activate allergicreactions to foreign particles Other criteria that may be used to support the diag nosis include the presence of Aspergillus in samples of the patients sputum the coughing up of plugs of brownmucus or a late skin reaction to the Aspergillus antigen Laboratory tests The laboratory tests that are done to obtain this information include a complete blood count CBC a sputum culture a blood serum test of IgE levels and a skin test for the Aspergillus antigen In the skin test a small amount of antigen is injected into the upper layerof skin on the patients forearm about four inchesbelow the elbow If the patient has a high level of IgEantibodies in the tissue he or she will develop what iscalled a wheal and flare reaction in about minutes A wheal and flare reaction is characterized bythe eruption of a reddened itching spot on the skin Some patients with ABPA will develop the socalledlate reaction to the skin test in which a red soreswollen area develops about six to eight hours after theinitial reaction Aspergillus can sometimes be seen under a micro scope slide made from the patients sputum but the diagnosis is considered definite only when the fungus is cul tured in the laboratory Aspergillus is easy to culture and can be identified when it is stained with periodic acidSchiff PAS Calcofluor or potassium hydroxide KOHpreparations Diagnostic imaging Chest x rays and CT scans are used to check for the presence of fluid accumulation in the lungs and signs ofbronchiectasis Treatment ABPA is usually treated with prednisone Meti corten or other corticosteroids taken by mouth and with bronchodilators Antifungal drugs are notused to treat ABPA because it is caused by an allergic reaction to Aspergillus rather than by direct infection of tissue Followup care Patients with ABPA should be given periodic checkups with chest x rays and a spirometer test Aspirometer is an instrument that evaluates the patientslung capacity Prognosis Most patients with ABPA respond well to corticos teroid treatment Others have a chronic course with gradual improvement over time The best indicator of a goodprognosis is a longterm fall in the patients IgE levelPatients with lung complications from ABPA may develop severe airway obstruction Prevention ABPA is difficult to prevent because Aspergillus is a common fungus it can be found in the saliva and sputumof most healthy individuals Patients with ABPA can protect themselves somewhat by avoiding haystacks compost piles bogs marshes and other locations with wet orrotting vegetation by avoiding construction sites ornewly painted surfaces and by having their air conditioners

othersymptoms AP is also called HenochSchonlein purpuranamed after the two doctors who first described it Description Purpura is a bleeding disorder that occurs when capillaries rupture allowing small amounts of blood toaccumulate in the surrounding tissues In AP this occursbecause the capillaries are blocked by protein complexes GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Allergic purpuraGEM to A PM Page KEY TERMS Glomeruli Knots of capillaries in the kidneys responsible for filtering the blood singularglomerulusformed during an abnormal immune reaction The skin is the most obvious site of reaction but the joints gastrointestinal tract and kidneys are also often affected AP affects approximately people in the Unit ed States each year Most cases are children between theages of two and seven Boys are affected more often thangirls and most cases occur from late fall to winter Causes and symptoms Causes AP is caused by a reaction involving antibodies spe cial proteins of the immune system Antibodies aredesigned to bind with foreign proteins called antigensIn some situations antigenantibody complexes canbecome too large to remain suspended in the bloodstream When this occurs they precipitate out andbecome lodged in the capillaries This can cause the capillary to burst allowing a local hemorrhage The source of the antigen causing AP is unknown Antigens may be introduced by bacterial or viral infection More than of patients report having had aninfection of the throat upper respiratory tract or gastrointestinal system several weeks before the onset of APOther complex molecules can act as antigens as wellincluding drugs such as antibiotics or vaccines Other wise harmless substances that stimulate an immune reaction are known as allergens Drug allergens that maycause AP include penicillin ampicillin erythromycinand quinine Vaccines possibly linked to AP includethose for typhoid measles cholera and yellow fever Symptoms The onset of AP may be preceded by a headache fever and loss of appetite Most patients first develop an itchy skin rash The rash is red either flat or raised andmay be small and frecklelike The rash may also be larger resembling a bruise Rashes become purple and then rust colored over the course of a day and fade after several weeks Rashes are most common on the buttocksabdomen and lower extremities Rashes higher on thebody may also occur especially in younger children Joint pain and swelling is common especially in the knees and ankles Abdominal pain occurs in almostall patients along with blood in the body waste fecesAbout half of all patients show blood in the urine lowurine volume or other signs of kidney involvementKidney failure may occur due to widespread obstructionof the capillaries in the filtering structures calledglomeruli Kidney failure develops in about of allpatients and in of those with elevated blood or protein in the urineLess common symptoms include prolonged head ache fever and pain and swelling of the scrotum Involvement of other organ systems may lead to heart attack myocardial infarction inflammation of the pancreaspancreatitis intestinal obstruction or bowel perforation Diagnosis Diagnosis of AP is based on the symptoms and their development a careful medical history and blood andurine tests X rays or computed tomography scans CT may be performed to assess complications in the bowelor other internal organs Treatment Most cases of AP resolve completely without treat ment Nonetheless a hospital stay is required because ofthe possibility of serious complications Nonaspirin painrelievers may be given for joint pain Corticosteroids like prednisone are sometimes used although not all specialists agree on their utility Kidney involvement requiresmonitoring and correction of blood fluids and electrolytes Patients with severe kidney complications may require a kidney biopsy so that tissue can be analyzed Even after all other symptoms subside elevated levels ofblood or protein in the urine may persist for months andrequire regular monitoring Hypertension or kidney fail ure may develop months or even years after the acutephase of the disease Kidney failure requires dialysis ortransplantation Plasmapheresis which removes antibodies from the blood has been tried for AP with mixed results Prognosis Most people who develop AP become better on their own after several

commonly referred to as hay fever is an inflammation of the nasal passages caused by allergic reaction to airborne substances Description Allergic rhinitis AR is the most common allergic condition and one of the most common of all minorafflictions It affects between of all people inthe United States and is responsible for of all doctor visits Antihistamines and other drugs used to treat allergic rhinitis make up a significant fraction of bothprescription and overthecounter drug sales each year There are two types of allergic rhinitis seasonal and perennial Seasonal AR occurs in the spring summerand early fall when airborne plant pollens are at theirhighest levels In fact the term hay fever is really a misnomer since allergy to grass pollen is only one cause ofsymptoms for most people Perennial AR occurs all yearand is usually caused by home or workplace airbornepollutants A person can be affected by one or both typesSymptoms of seasonal AR are worst after being outdoors while symptoms of perennial AR are worst afterspending time indoors Both types of allergies can develop at any age although onset in childhood through early adulthood ismost common Although allergy to a particular substanceis not inherited increased allergic sensitivity may run inthe family While allergies can improve on their ownover time they can also become worse over time Causes and symptoms Causes Allergic rhinitis is a type of immune reaction Nor mally the immune system responds to foreign microorganisms or particles like pollen or dust by producingspecific proteins called antibodies that are capable ofbinding to identifying molecules or antigens on the foreign particle This reaction between antibody and antigensets off a series of reactions designed to protect the bodyfrom infection Sometimes this same series of reactionsis triggered by harmless everyday substances This is thecondition known as allergy and the offending substanceis called an allergen Like all allergic reactions AR involves a special set of cells in the immune system known as mast cellsMast cells found in the lining of the nasal passagesand eyelids display a special type of antibody calledimmunoglobulin type E IgE on their surface Insidemast cells store reactive chemicals in small packetscalled granules When the antibodies encounter allergens they trigger release of the granules which spillout their chemicals onto neighboring cells includingblood vessels and nerve cells One of these chemicalshistamine binds to the surfaces of these other cellsthrough special proteins called histamine receptorsInteraction of histamine with receptors on blood vessels causes neighboring cells to become leaky leadingto the fluid collection swelling and increased rednesscharacteristic of a runny nose and red irritated eyesHistamine also stimulates pain receptors causing the itchy scratchy nose eyes and throat common in allergic rhinitis The number of possible airborne allergens is enor mous Seasonal AR is most commonly caused by grassand tree pollens since their pollen is produced in largeamounts and is dispersed by the wind Showy flowerslike roses or lilacs that attract insects produce a stickypollen which is less likely to become airborne Differentplants release their pollen at different times of the yearso seasonal AR sufferers may be most affected in springsummer or fall depending on which plants provoke aresponse The amount of pollen in the air is reflected inthe pollen count often broadcast on the daily news during allergy season Pollen counts tend to be lower after agood rain that washes the pollen out of the air and higheron warm dry windy days Virtually any type of tree or grass may cause AR A few types of weeds that tend to cause the most trouble forpeople include the following ragweed sagebrush lambsquarters plantain pigweed docksorrel GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Allergic rhinitisGEM to A PM Page tumbleweed Perennial AR is often triggered by house dust a complicated mixture of airborne particles many ofwhich are potent allergens House dust contains some orall of the following house mite body parts All houses contain large num bers of microscopic insects called house mites Theseharmless insects feed on fibers fur and skin shed bythe houses larger occupants Their tiny body parts easily become airborne animal dander Animals constantly shed fur skin flakes and dried saliva Carried in the air or transferred frompet to owner by direct contact dander can cause allergyin many sensitive people mold spores Molds live in damp spots throughout the house including basements bathrooms air ducts airconditioners refrigerator drains damp windowsillsmattresses and stuffed furniture Mildew and othermolds release airborne spores which circulate through out the house Other potential causes of perennial allergic rhinitis include the following cigarette smoke perfume cosmetics cleansers copier chemicals industrial chemicals construction material gases Symptoms Inflammation of the nose or rhinitis is the major symptom of AR Inflammation causes itching sneezing runny nose redness and tenderness Sinus swelling canconstrict the eustachian tube that connects the inner earto the throat causing a congested feeling and ear popping The drip of mucus from the sinuses down the backof the throat combined with increased sensitivity canalso lead to throat irritation and redness AR usually alsocauses redness itching and watery eyes Fatigue and headache are also common Diagnosis Diagnosing seasonal AR is usually easy and can often be done without a medical specialist When symptoms appear in spring or summer and disappear with theonset of cold weather seasonal AR is almost certainlythe culprit Other causes of rhinitis including infectioncan usually be ruled out by a physical examination and a nasal smear in which a sample of mucus is taken on aswab for examination Allergy tests including skin testing and provoca tion testing can help identify the precise culprit butmay not be done unless a single source is suspected andsubsequent avoidance is possible Skin testing involvesplacing a small amount of liquid containing a specificallergen on the skin and then either poking scratchingor injecting it into the skin surface to observe whetherredness and swelling occurs Provocation testinginvolves challenging an individual with either a smallamount of an inhalable or ingestable allergen to see if aresponse is elicited Perennial AR can also usually be diagnosed by care ful questioning about the timing of exposure and theonset of symptoms Specific allergens can be identifiedthrough allergy skin testing GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Allergic rhinitis This illustration depicts excessive mucus production in the nose after inhalation of airborne pollen Photo Researchers Inc Reproduced by permissionGEM to A PM Page Treatment Avoidance of the allergens is the best treatment but this is often not possible When it is not possible to avoidone or more allergens there are two major forms of medical treatment drugs and immunotherapy Drugs ANTIHISTAMINES Antihistamines block the hista mine receptors on nasal tissue decreasing the effect ofhistamine release by mast cells They may be used aftersymptoms appear though they may be even more effective when used preventively before symptoms appear Awide variety of antihistamines are available Older antihistamines often produce drowsiness as a major side effect Such antihistamines include the following diphenhydramine Benadryl and generics chlorpheniramine Chlortrimeton and generics brompheniramine Dimetane and generics clemastine Tavist and generics Newer antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness are available by prescription and include the following astemizole Hismanal loratidine Claritin fexofenadine Allegra azelastin HCl Astelin Hismanal has the potential to cause serious heart arrhythmias when taken with the antibiotic ery thromycin the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and itraconazole or the antimalarial drug quinine Taking morethan the recommended dose of Hismanal can also causearrhythimas Seldane terfenadine the original nondrowsy antihistamine was voluntarily withdrawn fromthe market by its manufacturers in early because ofthis potential and because of the availability of an equally effective safer alternative drug fexofenadine DECONGESTANTS Decongestants constrict blood vessels to counteract the effects of histamine Nasal spraysare available that can be applied directly to the nasal liningand oral systemic preparations are available Decongestantsare stimulants and may cause increased heart rate and bloodpressure headaches and agitation Use of topical decongestants for longer than several days can cause loss of effectiveness and rebound congestion in which nasal passagesbecome more severely swollen than before treatment TOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS Topical corticos teroids reduce mucous membrane inflammation and are available by prescription Allergies tend to become worseas the season progresses because the immune system becomes sensitized to particular antigens and can produce a faster stronger response Topical corticosteroidsare especially effective at reducing this seasonal sensitization because they work more slowly and last longerthan most other medication types As a result they arebest started before allergy season begins Side effects areusually mild but may include headaches nosebleedsand unpleasant taste sensations MAST CELL STABILIZERS Cromolyn sodium prevents the release of mast cell granules thereby preventingrelease of histamine and the other chemicals contained inthem It acts as a preventive treatment if it is begun several weeks before the onset of the allergy season It can beused for perennial AR as well Immunotherapy Immunotherapy also known as desensitization or allergy shots alters the balance of antibody types in thebody thereby reducing the ability of IgE to cause allergicreactions Immunotherapy is preceded by allergy testingto determine the precise allergens responsible Injectionsinvolve very small but gradually increasing amounts ofallergen over several weeks or months with periodicboosters Full benefits may take up to several years toachieve and are not seen at all in about one in fivepatients Individuals receiving all shots will be monitoredclosely following each shot because of the small risk ofanaphylaxis a condition that can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp drop in blood pressure Alternative treatment Alternative treatments for AR often focus on modu lation of the bodys immune response and frequentlycenter around diet and lifestyle adjustments Chineseherbal medicine can help rebalance a persons system ascan both acute and constitutional homeopathic treatmentVitamin C in substantial amounts can help stabilize themucous membrane response For symptom relief western herbal remedies including eyebright Euphrasia officinalis and nettle Urtica dioica may be helpful Bee pollen may also be effective in alleviating or eliminating AR symptoms Prognosis Most people with AR can achieve adequate relief with a combination of preventive strategies and treatment While allergies may improve over time they mayalso get worse or expand to include new allergens Earlytreatment can help prevent an increased sensitization toother allergens GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Allergic rhinitisGEM to A PM Page Prevention Reducing exposure to pollen may improve symp toms of seasonal AR Strategies include the following stay indoors with windows closed during the morning hours when pollen levels are highest keep car windows up while driving use a surgical face mask when outside avoid uncut fields learn which trees are producing pollen in which sea sons and avoid forests at the height of pollen season wash clothes and hair after being outside clean air conditioner filters in the home regularly use electrostatic filters for central air conditioning Moving to a region with lower pollen levels is rarely effective since new allergies often develop Preventing perennial AR requires identification of the responsible allergens Mold sporesKEY TERMS Allergen A substance that provokes an allergic response Anaphylaxis Increased sensitivity caused by pre vious exposure to an allergen

to A PM Page Description Allergies are among the most common of medical disorders It is estimated that million Americans ormore than one in every five people suffer from someform of allergy with similar proportions throughoutmuch of the rest of the world Allergy is the single largestreason for school absence and is a major source of lostproductivity in the workplace An allergy is a type of immune reaction Normally the immune system responds to foreign microorganismsor particles by producing specific proteins called antibodies These antibodies are capable of binding to identifying molecules or antigens on the foreign particleThis reaction between antibody and antigen sets off aseries of chemical reactions designed to protect thebody from infection Sometimes this same series ofreactions is triggered by harmless everyday substancessuch as pollen dust and animal danders When thisoccurs an allergy develops against the offending substance an allergen Mast cells one of the major players in allergic reac tions capture and display a particular type of antibodycalled immunoglobulin type E IgE that binds to allergens Inside mast cells are small chemicalfilled packetscalled granules Granules contain a variety of potentchemicals including histamine Immunologists separate allergic reactions into two main types immediate hypersensitivity reactions whichare predominantly mast cellmediated and occur withinminutes of contact with allergen and delayed hypersensitivity reactions mediated by T cells a type of whiteblood cells and occurring hours to days after exposure Inhaled or ingested allergens usually cause immedi ate hypersensitivity reactions Allergens bind to IgE antibodies on the surface of mast cells which spill the contents of their granules out onto neighboring cells including blood vessels and nerve cells Histamine binds to thesurfaces of these other cells through special proteinscalled histamine receptors Interaction of histamine withreceptors on blood vessels causes increased leakinessleading to the fluid collection swelling and increasedredness Histamine also stimulates pain receptors mak ing tissue more sensitive and irritable Symptoms lastfrom one to several hours following contact In the upper airways and eyes immediate hypersen sitivity reactions cause the runny nose and itchy bloodshot eyes typical of allergic rhinitis In the gastrointesti nal tract these reactions lead to swelling and irritation ofthe intestinal lining which causes the cramping anddiarrhea typical of food allergy Allergens that enter thecirculation may cause hives angioedema anaphylaxis or atopic dermatitis Allergens on the skin usually cause delayed hyper sensitivity reaction Roving T cells contact the allergensetting in motion a more prolonged immune responseThis type of allergic response may develop over severaldays following contact with the allergen and symptomsmay persist for a week or more Causes and symptoms Allergens enter the body through four main routes the airways the skin the gastrointestinal tract and thecirculatory system Airborne allergens cause the sneezing runny nose and itchy bloodshot eyes of hay fever allergic rhini tis Airborne allergens can also affect the lining of the lungs causing asthma or the conjunctiva of the eyes causing conjunctivitis pink eye Exposure to cock roach allergans have been associated with the development of asthma Airborne allergans from householdpets are another common source of environmentalexposure Allergens in food can cause itching and swelling of the lips and throat cramps and diarrhea When absorbedinto the bloodstream they may cause hives urticariaor more severe reactions involving recurrent noninflammatory swelling of the skin mucous membranesorgans and brain angioedema Some food allergensmay cause anaphylaxisa potentially lifethreateningcondition marked by tissue swelling airwayconstriction and drop in blood pressure Allergies to foods suchcows milk eggs nuts fish and legumes peanuts andsoybeans are common Allergies to fruits and vegetables may also occur In contact with the skin allergens can cause redden ing itching and blistering called contact dermatitis Skin reactions can also occur from allergens introduced through the airways or gastrointestinal tractThis type of reaction is known as atopic dermatitis Dermatitis may arise from an allergic response suchas from poison ivy or exposure to an irritant causingnonimmune damage to skin cells such as soap coldand chemical agents Injection of allergens from insect bites and stings or drug administration can introduce allergens directlyinto the circulation where they may cause systemwideresponses including anaphylaxis as well as the localones of swelling and irritation at the injection site People

PM Page sitive to nuts but not to any other food Allergies may get worse over time For example childhood ragweedallergy may progress to yearround dust and pollenallergy On the other hand a person may lose allergicsensitivity Infant or childhood atopic dermatitis disappears in almost all people More commonly whatseems to be loss of sensitivity is instead a reducedexposure to allergens or an increased tolerance for thesame level of symptoms While allergy to specific allergens is not inherited the likelihood of developing some type of allergy seemsto be at least for many people If neither parent hasallergies the chances of a child developing allergy isapproximately if one parent has allergies it is and if both have allergies it is Onesource of this genetic predisposition is in the ability toproduce higher levels of IgE in response to allergensThose who produce more IgE will develop a strongerallergic sensitivity COMMON ALLERGENS The most common airborne allergens are the following plant pollens animal fur and dander body parts from house mites microscopic creatures found in all houses house dust mold spores cigarette smoke solvents cleaners Common food allergens include the following nuts especially peanuts walnuts and brazil nuts fish mollusks and shellfish eggs wheat milk food additives and preservatives The following types of drugs commonly cause aller gic reactions penicillin or other antibiotics flu vaccines tetanus toxoid vaccine gamma globulin Common causes of contact dermatitis include the following poison ivy oak and sumac nickel or nickel alloys latex Insects and other arthropods whose bites or stings typically cause allergy include the following bees wasps and hornets mosquitoes fleas scabies Symptoms depend on the specific type of allergic reaction Allergic rhinitis is characterized by an itchyrunny nose often with a scratchy or irritated throat dueto postnasal drip Inflammation of the thin membranecovering the eye allergic conjunctivitis causes rednessirritation and increased tearing in the eyes Asthma causes wheezing coughing and shortness of breath Symp toms of food allergies depend on the tissues most sensitive to the allergen and whether the allergen spread systemically by the circulatory system Gastrointestinalsymptoms may include swelling and tingling in the lipstongue palate or throat nausea cramping diarrhea andgas Contact dermatitis is marked by reddened itchyweepy skin blisters and an eczema that is slow to heal Itsometimes has a characteritic manmade pattern such asa glove allergy with clear demarkation on the handswrist and arms where the gloves are worn or on the earlobes by wearing earrings Whole body or systemic reactions may occur from any type of allergen but are more common followingingestion or injection of an allergen Skin reactionsinclude the raised reddened and itchy patches calledhives that characteristically blanch with pressure andresolve within twentyfour hours A deeper and moreextensive skin reaction involving more extensive fluidcollection and pain is called angioedema This usuallyoccurs on the extremities fingers toes and parts of theheadneckand face Anaphylaxis is marked by airwayconstriction blood pressure drop widespread tissueswelling heart rhythm abnormalities and in some casesloss of consciousness Other syptoms may include dizzi ness weakness seizures coughingflushing or cramp ing The symptoms may begin within five minutes afterexposure to the allergan up to one hour or more laterMast cells in the tissues and basophils in the

individuals anaphylaxis canoccur with exercise plasma exchange hemodialysis reaction to insulin radocontrast media used in certain GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AllergiesGEM to A PM Page types of medical tests and rarely during the administra tion of local anesthetics Diagnosis Allergies can often be diagnosed by a careful med ical history matching the onset of symptoms to theexposure to possible allergens Allergy is suspected ifthe symptoms presented are characteristic of an allergicreaction and this occurs repeatedly upon exposure tothe suspected allergan Allergy tests can be used to identify potential allergens but these must be supportedby eveidence of allergic responses in the patients clinical history Skin tests Skin tests are performed by administering a tiny dose of the suspected allergen by pricking scratchingpuncturing or injecting the skin The allergen is appliedto the skin as an auqeous extract usually on the backforearms or top of the thighs Once in the skin the allergen may produce a classic immune wheal and flareresponse a skin lesion with a raise white compressiblearea surrounded by a red flare The tests usually beginwith prick tests or patch tests that expose the skin to small amounts of allergen to observe the response Apositive reaction will occur on the skin even if the allergen is at levels normally encountered in food or in theairways Reactions are usually evaluated approximatelyfifteen minutes after exposure Intradermal skin testsinvolved injection of the allergan into the dermis of theskin These tests are more sensitive and are used forallergies associated with risk of death such as allergies to antibiotics AllergenSpecific IgE Measurement Tests that measure allergenspecific IgE antibodies generally follow a basic method The allergen is boundto a solid support either in the form of a cellulosesponge microtiter plate or paper disk The patientsserum is prepared from a blood sample and is incubatedwith the solid phase If allergen specific IgE antibodiesare present they will bind to the solid phase and beretained there when the rest of the serum is washedaway Next an labeled antibody against the IgE is addedand will bind to any IgE on the solid phase The excessis washed away and the levels of IgE are determinedThe commonly used RAST test radio allergo sorbent GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Allergies Allergic rhinitis is commonly triggered by exposure to household dust animal furor pollen The foreign substance thattriggers an allergic reaction is calledan allergen The presence of an allergen causes the

assay Someresearch indicates that there is a higher level of totalserum IgE in allergic as compared to nonallergic people However this may not always be the case as there isconsiderable overlap between the two groupsThis test isuseful for the diagnosis of allergic fungal sinusitis and bronchopulmonary aspergillosis Other conditions that are not allergic in nature may give rise to higher IgE levels such as smoking AIDS infection with parasites and IgE myeloma Provocation tests These tests involve the administration of allergen to ellicit an immune response Provocation tests most commonly done with airborne allergens present the allergendirectly through the route normally involved Delayedallergic contact dermatitis diagnosis involves similarmethods by application of a skin patch with allergen toinduce an allergic skin reaction Food allergen provocation tests require abstinence from the suspect allergen fortwo weeks or more followed by ingestion of a measuredamount of the test substance administered as an opaquecapsule along with a placebo control Provocation testsare not used if anaphylaxis is is a concern due to thepatients medical history Future diagnostic methods As of attempts have been made for direct measurement of immune mediators such as histamineeosinophil cationic protein ECP and mast celltryptase Another somewhat controversialtest is electrodermal testing or electroacupuncture allergy testingThis test has been used in Europe and is under investigation in the United States though not approved by theFood and Drug Administration An electric potential isapplied to the skin the allergen presented and the electrical resistance observed for changes This method hasnot been verified Treatment Avoiding allergens is the first line of defense to reduce the possibility of an allergic attack It is helpful toavoid environmental irritants such as tobacco smokeperfumes household cleaning agents paints glues airfresheners and potpourri Nitrogen dioxide from poorly vented gas stoves woodburing stoves and artificial fireplaces has also been linked to poor asthma control Dustmite control is particularly important in the bedroomareas by use of allergenimpermeable covers on mattressand pillows frequent washing of bedding in hotwaterand removal of items that collect dust such asstuffed toys Mold growth may be reduced by reducingindoor

encountered environmental substances Purpose Allergy is a reaction of the immune system Nor mally the immune system responds to foreign microorganisms and particles like pollen or dust by producingspecific proteins called antibodies that are capable ofbinding to identifying molecules or antigens on theforeign organisms This reaction between antibody andantigen sets off a series of reactions designed to protectthe body from infection Sometimes this same series ofreactions is triggered by harmless everyday substancesThis is the condition known as allergy and the offending substance is called an allergen Common inhaledallergens include pollen dust and insect parts from tinyhouse mites Common food allergens include nuts fishand milk Allergic reactions involve a special

Page gen either through inhalation or ingestion Positive reac tions from any of these tests may be used to narrow thecandidates for the actual allergen causing the allergy Identification of the allergenic substance may allow the patient to avoid the substance and reduce allergicreactions In addition allergy testing may be done inthose with asthma that is difficult to manage eczema or skin rashes to determine if an allergy is causing the con dition or making it worse Allergy tests may also be donebefore allergen desensitization to ensure the safety ofmore extensive exposure Skin testing is the most common type of allergy test There are two forms percutaneous and intradermal Inpercutaneous or prick testing allergen solutions areplaced on the skin and the skin is then pricked with aneedle allowing the allergen to enter the skin andbecome exposed to mast cells Scratch testing in whichthe skin is scratched instead of punctured is used lessoften Intradermal testing involves directly injectingallergen solutions into the skin In both tests a reddenedswollen spot develops at the injection site for each substance to which the person is sensitive Skin reactivity isseen for allergens regardless of whether they usuallyaffect the skin In other words airborne and food allergens cause skin reactions equally well The range of allergens used for testing is chosen to reflect possible sources in the environment and mayinclude the following pollen from a variety of trees common grasses and weeds mold and fungus spores house dust house mites animal skin cells dander and saliva food extracts antibiotics insect venoms Radioallergosorbent testing RAST is a laboratory test performed when a person may be too sensitive to riskskin testing or when medications or skin conditions prevent it Provocation testing is done to positively identify suspected allergens after preliminary skin testing A purified preparation of the allergen is inhaled or ingested inincreasing concentrations to determine if it will provokea response Food testing is much more tedious thaninhalation testing since full passage through the digestive system may take a day or morePrecautions While allergy tests are quite safe for most people the possibility of a condition known as anaphylaxis does exist Anaphylaxis is a potentially dangerous conditionthat can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp drop inblood pressure People with a known history of anaphylaxis should inform the testing clinician Skin testsshould never include a substance known to cause anaphylaxis in the person being tested Provocation tests may cause an allergic reaction Therefore treatment medications should be available following the tests to be administered if needed Description In prick testing a drop of each allergen to be tested is placed on the skin usually on the forearm or the backA typical battery of tests may involve two dozen allergendrops including a drop of saline solution that should notprovoke a reaction negative control and a drop of histamine that should provoke a reaction positive control Asmall needle is inserted through the drop and used toprick the skin below A new needle is used for each prickThe sites are examined over the next twenty minutes forevidence of swelling and redness indicating a positivereaction In some instances a tracing of the set of reactions may be made by placing paper over the tested areaSimilarly in intradermal testing separate injections aremade for each allergen tested Observations are madeover the next twenty minutes In RAST testing

themedium used to dilute the allergen has been determinedOnce this has been determined the patient inhales increasingly concentrated samples of a particular allergen followed each time by measurement of the exhalation capacity Only one allergen is tested per day Testing for foodallergies is usually done by removing the suspect food from the diet for two weeks followed by eating a singleportion of the suspect food and followup monitoring Preparation Skin testing is preceded by a brief examination of the skin The patient should refrain from using antiallergy drugs for at least hours before testing Prior toinhalation testing patients with asthma who can tolerateit may be asked to stop any asthma medications Testingfor food allergies requires the person to avoid all suspectfood for at least two weeks before testing Aftercare Skin testing does not usually require any aftercare A generalized redness and swelling may occur in the testarea but it will usually resolve within a day or two Inhalation tests may cause delayed asthma attacks even if the antigen administered in the test initially produced no response Severe initial reactions may justifyclose professional observation for at least hours aftertestingRisks Intradermal testing may inadvertently result in the injection of the allergen into the circulation with anincreased risk of adverse reactions Inhalation tests mayprovoke an asthma attack Exposure to new or unsuspected allergens in any test carries the risk of anaphylaxisBecause patients are monitored following allergy testingan anaphylactic reaction is usually recognized and treated promptly Occasionally a delayed anaphylacticresponse can occur that will require immediate careProper patient education regarding how to recognize anaphylaxis is vital

to having it killed off by cancer chemo therapy Some causes are considered natural while oth ers signal serious health problems Some conditions areconfined to the scalp Others reflect disease throughoutthe body Being plainly visible the skin and its components can provide early signs of disease elsewhere in thebody Oftentimes conditions affecting the skin of the scalp will result in hair loss The first clue to the specific causeis the pattern of hair loss whether it be complete baldness alopecia totalis patchy bald spots thinning orhair loss confined to certain areas Also a factor is thecondition of the hair and the scalp beneath it Sometimesonly the hair is affected sometimes the skin is visiblydiseased as wellCauses and symptoms Male pattern baldness androgenic alopecia is consid ered normal in adult males It is easily recognized bythe distribution of hair loss over the top and front of thehead and by the healthy condition of the scalp Alopecia areata is a hair loss condition of unknown cause that can be patchy or extend to complete baldness Fungal infections of the scalp usually cause patchy hair loss The fungus similar to the ones that cause athletes footand ringworm often glows under ultraviolet light Trichotillomania is the name of a mental disorder that causes a person to pull out hisher own hair Complete hair loss is a common result of cancer chemotherapy due to the toxicity of the drugs usedPlacing a tourniquet around the skull just above the earsduring the intravenous infusion of the drugs mayreduce or eliminate hair loss by preventing the drugsfrom reaching the scalp Systemic diseases often affect hair growth either selec tively or by altering the skin of the scalp One exampleis thyroid disorders Hyperthyroidism too much thy roid

Dermatologists are skilled in diagnosis by sight alone For more obscure diseases they may have toresort to a skin biopsy removing a tiny bit of skin using a local anesthetic so that it can examined under a microscope Systemic diseases will require a complete evaluation by a physician including specific tests to identifyand characterize the problem Treatment Successful treatment of underlying causes is most likely to restore hair growth be it the completion ofchemotherapy effective cure of a scalp fungus or controlof a systemic disease Two relatively new drugsminoxidil Rogaine and

the bodytime minoxidil produces satisfactory results in about one quarter of patients with androgenic alopecia and as manyas half the patients with alopecia areata There is also anoverthecounter extrastrength version of minoxidil concentration approved for use by men only The treatment often results in new hair that is thinner and lighterin color It is important to note that new hair stops growing soon after the use of minoxidil is discontinued Over the past few decades there have appeared a multitude of hair replacement methods performed byboth physicians and nonphysicians They range fromsimply weaving someone elses hair in with the remainsof your own to surgically transplanting thousands of hairfollicles one at a time Hair transplantation is completed by taking tiny plugs of skin each containing one to several hairsfrom the back side of the scalp The bald sections arethen implanted with the plugs Research completed in looked at the new technique of hair grafting andfound that micrografts one to two hairs transplantedper follicle resulted in fewer complications and thebest results Another surgical procedure used to treat androgenic alopecia is scalp reduction By stretching skin the hairless scalp can be removed and the area of bald skindecreased by closing the space with haircovered scalpHairbearing skin can also be folded over an area of baldskin with a technique called a flap Prognosis The prognosis varies with the cause It is generally much easier to lose hair than to regrow it Even when itreturns it is often thin and less attractive than the original

pregnancy This screening test mea sures the level of AFP in the mothers blood and indicates the probability that the fetus has one of several serious birth defects The level of AFP can also be deter mined by analyzing a sample of amniotic fluid Thisscreening test cannot diagnose a specific condition itonly indicates the increase of risk for several birthdefects Outside pregnancy the AFP test is used to detectliver disease certain cancerous tumors and to monitorthe progress of cancer treatment Purpose Alphafetoprotein is a substance produced by the liver of a fetus The exact function of this protein isunknown After birth the infants liver stops producingAFP and an adult liver contains only trace amountsDuring pregnancy the fetus excretes AFP in urine andsome of the protein crosses the fetal membranes to enterthe mothers blood The level of AFP can then be determined by analyzing a sample of the mothers blood Byanalyzing the amount of AFP found in a blood or amniotic fluid sample doctors can determine the probabilitythat the fetus is at risk for certain birth defects It is veryimportant that the doctor know precisely how old thefetus is when the test is performed since the AFP levelchanges over the length of the pregnancy Alone AFPscreening cannot diagnose a birth defect The test isused as an indicator of risk and then an appropriate lineof testing like amniocentesis or ultrasound follows based on the results Abnormally high AFP may indicate that the fetus has an increased risk of a neural tube defect the mostcommon and severe type of disorder associated withincreased AFP These types of defects include spinalcolumn defects spina bifida and anencephaly a severe and usually fatal brain abnormality If the tubethat becomes the brain and spinal cord does not closecorrectly during fetal development AFP may leakthrough this abnormal opening and enter the amnioticfluid This leakage creates abnormally high levels ofAFP in amniotic fluid and in maternal blood If thescreening test indicates abnormally high AFP ultrasound is used to diagnosis the problem Other fetal conditions that can raise AFP levels above normal include cysts at the end of the spine blockage in the esophagus or intestines liver disease causing liver cells to die defects in the abdominal wall kidney or urinary tract defects or disease brittle bone disease Levels may also be high if there is too little fluid in the amniotic sac around the fetus more than one developing fetus or a pregnancy that is farther along thanestimated For unknown reasons abnormally low AFP may indicate that the fetus has an increased risk of Down syndrome Down syndrome is a condition that includes mental retardation and a distinctive physical appearance linked to an abnormality of chromosome called trisomy If the screening test indicatesan abnormally low AFP amniocentesis is used to diagnosis the problem Abnormally low levels of AFP canalso occur when the fetus has died or when the motheris overweight AFP is often part of a triple check blood test that analyzes three substances as risk indicators of possiblebirth defects AFP estriol and human chorionicgonadotropin HCG When all three substances are measured in the mothers blood the accuracy of the testresults increases Although AFP in human blood gradually disappears after birth it never disappears entirely It may reappear inliver disease or tumors of the liver ovaries or testiclesThe AFP test is used to screen people at high risk forthese conditions After a cancerous tumor is removed an GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Alphafetoprotein testGEM to A PM Page AFP test can monitor the progress of treatment Contin ued high AFP levels suggest the cancer is growing Precautions It is very important that the doctor know precisely how old the fetus is when the test is performed since theAFP level considered normal changes over the length ofthe pregnancy Errors in determining the age of the fetuslead to errors when interpreting the test results Since anAFP test is only a screening tool more specific testsmust follow to make an accurate diagnosis An abnormaltest result does not necessarily mean that the fetus has abirth defect The test has a high rate of abnormal resultseither high or low in order to prevent missing a fetusthat has a serious condition Description The AFP test is usually performed at week of pregnancy Blood is drawn from a vein usually on theinside of the elbow AFP can also be measured in the sample of amniotic fluid taken at the time of amniocentesisTest results are usually available after about one week Preparation There is no specific physical preparation for the AFP test Aftercare There is no specific aftercare involved with this screening test Risks The risks associated with drawing blood are mini mal but may include bleeding from the puncture sitefeeling faint or lightheaded after the blood is drawn orblood accumulating under the puncture site hematoma Normal results

Alphaadrenergic blockers are drugs that work by blocking the alphareceptors of vascular smooth muscle thus preventing the uptake of catecholamines by thesmooth muscle cells This causes vasodilation and allowsblood to flow more easily Purpose These drugs called alpha blockers for short are used for two main purposes to treat high blood pressurehypertension and to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH a condition that affects men and is characterizedby an enlarged prostate gland High blood pressure High blood pressure puts a strain on the heart and the arteries Over time hypertension can damage theblood vessels to the point of causing stroke heart fail ureor kidney failure People with high blood pressure may also be at higher risk for heart attacks Controllinghigh blood pressure makes these problems less likelyAlpha blockers help lower blood pressure by causingvasodilation meaning an increase in the diameter of theblood vessels which allows blood to flow more easily Benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH This condition particularly affects older men Over time the prostate a donutshaped gland below the bladder enlarges When this happens it may interfere withthe passage of urine from the bladder out of the bodyMen who are diagnosed with BPH may have to urinatemore often Or they may feel that they can not completely empty their bladders Alpha blockers inhibit the contraction of prostatic smooth muscle and thus relax muscles in the prostate and the bladder allowing urine toflow more freely Description Commonly prescribed alpha blockers for hyperten sion and BPH include doxazosin Cardura prazosinMinipress and terazosin Hytrin Prazosin is also usedin the treatment of heart failure All are available onlywith a physicians prescription and are sold in tablet form Recommended dosage The recommended dose depends on the patient and the type of alpha blocker and may change over the courseof treatment The prescribing physician will graduallyincrease the dosage if necessary Some patients may needas much as mg per day of terazosin mg per dayof doxazosin or as much as mg per day of prazosinbut most people benefit from lower doses As the dosageincreases so does the possibility of unwanted side effects Alpha blockers should be taken exactly as directed even if the medication does not seem to be working atfirst It should not be stopped even if symptoms improvebecause it needs to be taken regularly to be effectivePatients should avoid missing any doses and should nottake larger or more frequent doses to make up formissed doses Precautions Alpha blockers may lower blood pressure to a greater extent than desired This can cause dizziness lightheadedness heart palpitations and fainting Activ ities such as driving using machines or doing anythingelse that might be dangerous for hours after taking thefirst dose should be avoided Patients should be remindedto be especially careful not to fall when getting up in themiddle of the night The same precautions are recommended if the dosage is increased or if the drug has beenstopped and then started again Anyone whose safety onthe job could be affected by taking alpha blockers shouldinform his or her physician so that the physician cantake this factor into account when increasing dosage Dizziness lightheadedness and fainting are more like ly to occur when people taking alpha blockers also drinkalcohol exercise stand for a long time or are exposed to hot weather Extra care should be used under these conditions and alcohol consumption should be limited Some people may feel drowsy or less alert when using these drugs They should accordingly avoid drivingor performing activities that require full attention People diagnosed with kidney disease or liver disease may also be more sensitive to alpha blockers They shouldinform their physicians about these conditions if alphablockers are prescribed Older people may also be moresensitive and may be more likely to have unwanted sideeffects such as fainting dizziness and lightheadedness It should be noted that alpha blockers do not cure high blood pressure They simply help to keep the condition under control Similarly these drugs will not shrinkan enlarged prostate gland Although they will helprelieve the symptoms of prostate enlargement theprostate may continue to grow and it eventually may benecessary

may be necessary Description Alport syndrome affects about one in Ameri cans striking men more often and severely than womenThere are several varieties of the syndrome some occurring in childhood and others not causing symptoms untilmen reach their s or s All varieties of the syndromeare characterized by kidney disease that usually progresses to chronic kidney failure and by uremia the presence of excessive amounts of urea and other wasteproducts in the blood Causes and symptoms Alport syndrome in most cases is caused by a defect in one or more genes located on the X chromosome It isusually inherited from the mother who is a normal carrier However in up to of cases there is no family history of the disorder In these cases there appears to be aspontaneous genetic mutation causing Alport syndrome Blood in the urine hematuria is a hallmark of Alport syndrome Other symptoms that may appear invarying combinations include protein in the urine proteinuria sensorineural hearing loss eye problems involuntary rhythmic eye movements nystagmus cataracts or cornea problems skin problems platelet disorders abnormal white blood cells smooth muscle tumorsKEY TERMS Albumin A protein that is important in maintain ing blood volume Low albumin levels is one signof Alport syndrome Dialysis A technique of removing waste material from the blood It is used with patients whose kidneys have stopped functioning and can no longercleanse the blood on their own Diuretic A drug that increases the amount of urine a person produces Hematuria Blood in the urine Hematuria is a hallmark of Alport syndrome Pulmonary edema Excess fluid in the air spaces of the lungs Uremia The presence of excessive amounts of urea and other waste products in the blood Not all patients with Alport syndrome have hearing problems In general those with normal hearing haveless severe cases of Alport syndrome Diagnosis Alport syndrome is diagnosed with a medical evalu ation and family history together with a kidney biopsy that can detect changes in the kidney typical of the condition Urinalysis may reveal blood or protein in the urine Blood tests can reveal a low platelet level In addition tests for the Alport gene are now avail able Although testing is fairly expensive it is covered bymany types of health insurance DNA tests can diagnoseaffected children even before birth and genetic linkagetests tracing all family members at risk for Alport syndrome are also available Treatment There is no specific treatment that can cure Alport syndrome Instead care is aimed at easing the problemsrelated to kidney failure such as the presence of toomany waste products in the blood uremia To control kidney inflammation nephritis patients should restrict fluids control high blood pressure manage pulmonary edema GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Alport syndromeGEM to A PM Page control high blood levels of potassium Rarely patients with Alport syndrome may develop nephrotic syndrome a group of symptoms including too much protein in the urine low albumin levels andswelling To ease these symptoms patients should drink less eat a saltfree diet use diuretics have albumin transfusions The treatment for chronic kidney failure is dialysis or a kidney transplant Prognosis Women with this condition can lead a normal life although they may have slight hearing loss An affectedwoman may notice blood in her urine only when understress or pregnant Men generally have a much more serious problem with the disease Most will experience kidney disease intheir s or s which may eventually require dialysis ortransplantation and many develop significant hearingloss Men with Alport syndrome often die of complications by middle age Prevention Alport syndrome is a genetic disease and prevention efforts are aimed at providing affected individuals andtheir families with information concerning the geneticmechanisms responsible for the disease Since it is possible to determine if a woman is a carrier or if an unbornchild has the condition genetic counseling can provide helpful information and support for the decisions thataffected individuals and their families may have to make Resources BOOKS Schrier R

symptoms varies with altitude it isimportant to understand the range of the different altitudes that may be involved High altitude is defined asheight greater than feet m medium altitudeis defined as height between and feet m and extreme altitude is defined asheight greater than feet m The majorityof healthy individuals suffer from altitude sickness whenthey reach very high altitudes In addition about ofpeople ascending above m feet in one daywill develop altitude sickness Children under six yearsand women in the premenstrual part of their cycles maybe more vulnerable Individuals with preexisting medicalconditionseven a minor respiratory infectionmaybecome sick at more moderate altitudes Description There are three major clinical syndromes that fall under the heading of altitude sickness acute mountainsickness AMS highaltitude pulmonary edema HAPE and highaltitude cerebral edema HACE These syndromes are not separate individual syndromesas much as they are a continuum of severity all resultingfrom a decrease in oxygen in the air AMS is the mildestand the other two represent severe lifethreatening formsof altitude sickness GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Altitude sicknessGEM to A PM Page Altitude sickness occurs because the partial pressure of oxygen decreases with altitude Partial pressure is aterm applied to gases that is similar to the way the termconcentration is applied to liquid solutions For instanceat feet m the partial pressure of oxygendrops to onehalf its value at sea level and therefore thereis a substantially lower amount of oxygen available for theindividual to inhale This is known as hypoxia Furthermore since there is less oxygen to inhale less oxygenreaches the blood This is known as hypoxemia These twoconditions are the major factors that form the basis for allthe medical problems associated with altitude sickness As a person becomes hypoxemic his natural response is to breathe more rapidly hyperventilate Thisis the bodys attempt to bring in more oxygen at a rapidrate This attempt at alleviating the effects of the hypoxiaat higher altitudes is known as acclimatization and itoccurs during the first few days Acclimatization is aresponse that occurs in individuals who travel from lowerto higher altitudes There are groups of people who havelived at high altitudes for example in the Himalayanand Andes mountains for generations and they are simply accustomed to living at such altitudes perhapsthrough a genetic ability Causes and symptoms Acute mountain sickness AMS is a mild form of altitude sickness that results from ascent to altitudes highergreater than feet meven feet m in some susceptible individuals Although hypoxia isassociated with the development of AMS the exact mechanism by which this condition develops has yet to be confirmed It is important to realize that some individualsacclimatize to higher altitudes more efficiently than othersAs a result under similar conditions some will suffer fromAMS while others will not At present the susceptibilityof otherwise healthy individuals to contracting AMS cannot be accurately predicted Of those who do suffer fromAMS the condition tends to be most severe on the secondor third day after reaching the high altitude and it usuallyabates after three to five days if they remain at the samealtitude However it can recur if the individuals travel toan even higher altitude Symptoms usually appear a fewhours to a few days following ascent and they includedizziness headache shortness of breath nausea vomit ing loss of appetite and insomnia Highaltitude pulmonary edema HAPE is a life threatening condition that afflicts a small percentage ofthose who suffer from AMS In this condition fluid leaksfrom within the pulmonary blood vessels into the lungtissue As this fluid begins to accumulate within the lungtissue pulmonary edema the individual begins toKEY TERMS Cerebral Pertaining to the brain Edema Accumulation of excess fluid in the tis sues of the body Hypoxemia Insufficient oxygenation of the blood Hypoxia A deficiency in the amount of oxygen required for effective ventilation Pulmonary Pertaining to the lungs become more and more short of breath HAPE is known to afflict all types of individuals regardless of their levelof physical fitness Typically the individual who suffers from HAPE ascends quickly to a high altitude and almost immediately develops shortness of breath a rapid heart rate acough productive of a large amount of sometimes bloody sputum and a rapid rate of breathing If no medical assistance is provided by this point the patient goes into acoma and dies within a few hours Highaltitude cerebral edema HACE the rarest and most severe form of altitude sickness involves cerebraledema and its mechanism of development is also poorlyunderstood The symptoms often begin with those ofAMS but neurologic symptoms such as an altered levelof consciousness speech abnormalities severe headacheloss of coordination hallucinations and even seizures If no intervention is implemented death is the result Diagnosis The diagnosis for altitude sickness may be made from the observation of the individuals symptoms during travel to higher altitudes Treatment Mild AMS requires no treatment other than an aspirin or ibuprofen for headache and avoidance of fur ther ascent Narcotics should be avoided because theymay blunt the respiratory response making it even moredifficult for the person to breathe deeply and rapidlyenough to compensate for the lower levels of oxygen inthe environment Oxygen may also be used to alleviatesymptoms of mild AMS As for HAPE and HACE the most important course of action is descent to a lower altitude as soon as possible

mental ability severe enough to interfere with normalactivities of daily living lasting at least six months andnot present from birth AD usually occurs in old age andis marked by a decline in cognitive functions such asremembering reasoning and planning Description A person with AD usually has a gradual decline in mental functions often beginning with slight memoryloss followed by losses in the ability to maintainemployment to plan and execute familiar tasks and toreason and exercise judgment Communication ability mood and personality may also be affected Most peoplewho have AD die within eight years of their diagnosisalthough that interval may be as short as one year or aslong as years AD is the fourth leading cause of death in adults after heart disease cancer and stroke Between two and four million Americans have AD that number is expected to grow to as many as million bythe middle of the st century as the population as a wholeages While a small number of people in their s and sdevelop the disease called earlyonset AD AD predominantly affects the elderly AD affects about of all peoplebetween ages and about of those between and and about of those over Slightly morewomen than men are affected with AD but this may bebecause women tend to live longer and so there is a higherproportion of women in the most affected age groups The costs for caring for a person with AD is consid erable The annual cost of caring for one AD patient in was estimated as about for a patient withmild AD for a patient with moderate AD and for a patient with severe AD The annual directand indirect costs of caring for AD patients in the UnitedStates was estimated to be as much as billionSlightly more than half of AD patients are cared for athome while the remainder are cared for in a variety ofhealth care institutions Causes and symptoms Causes The cause or causes of Alzheimers disease are unknown Some strong leads have been found throughrecent research however and these have also given sometheoretical support to several new experimental treatments GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Alzheimers diseaseGEM to A PM Page At first AD destroys neurons nerve cells in parts of the brain that control memory including the hippocampus which is a structure deep in the deep that controlsshortterm memory As these neurons in the hippocampusstop functioning the shortterm memory of the personfails and the ability to perform familiar tasks decreasesLater AD affects the cerebral cortex particularly the areasresponsible for language and reasoning this languageskills are lost and the ability to make judgments ischanged Personality changes occur which may includeemotional outbursts wandering and agitation The severity of these changes increases with the progression of thedisease Eventually many other areas of the brain becomeinvolved the brain regions affected atrophy shrink andlose function and the person with AD becomes bedridden incontinent helpless and nonresponsive Autopsy of a person with AD shows that the regions of the brain affected by the disease become clogged withtwo abnormal structures called neurofibrillary tanglesand amyloid plaques Neurofibrillary tangles are twistedmasses of protein fibers inside nerve cells or neurons InAD tau proteins which normally help bind and stabilizeparts of neurons is changed chemically become twistedand tangled and no longer can stabilize the neuronsAmyloid plaques consist of insoluble deposits of betaamyloid a protein fragment from a larger protein calledamyloid precursor protein APP mixed with parts of neurons and nonnerve cells Plaques are found in the spacesbetween the nerve cells of the brain While it is not clearexactly how these structures cause problems manyresearchers believe that their formation is responsible forthe mental changes of AD presumably by interferingwith the normal communication between neurons in thebrain and later leading to the death of neurons As of three drugs for the treatment of AD symptoms havebeen approved by the United States Food and DrugAdministration FDA They act by increasing the level ofchemical signaling molecules in the brain known as neurotransmitters to make up for this decreased communication ability All act by inhibiting the activity of acetylcholinesterase which is an enzyme that breaks downacetylcholine an important neurotransmitter released byneurons that is necessary for cognitive function Thesedrugs modestly increase cognition and improve onesability to perform normal activities of daily living What triggers the formation of plaques and tangles and the development of AD are unknown AD likelyresults from many interrelated factors including geneticenvironmental and others not yet identified Two typesof AD exist familial AD FAD which is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disease and sporadic AD withno obvious inheritance pattern AD is also described interms of age at onset with early onset AD occurring inpeople younger than and lateonset occurring in those and older Early onset AD comprises about ofAD cases and affects people aged to Some casesof early onset AD are inherited and are common in somefamilies Earlyonset AD often progresses faster than themore common lateonset type All FAD which are relatively uncommon that have been identified so far are the early onset type As manyas of the FAD cases are known to be caused by threegenes located on three different chromosomes Somefamilies have mutations in the APP gene located on chromosome which causes the production of abnormalAPP protein Others have mutations in a gene called presenilin located on chromosome which causes theproduction of abnormal presenilin protein and othershave mutations in a similar gene called presenilin located on chromosome which causes production of abnormal presenilin Presenilin may be one of the enzymesthat clips APP into betaamyloid it may also be importantin the synaptic connections between brain cells There is no evidence that the mutated genes that cause early onset FAD also cause late onset AD butgenetics does appear to play a role in this more commonform of AD Discovered by researchers at Duke University in the early s potentially the most importantgenetic link to AD was on chromosome A gene onthis chromosome called APOE apolipoprotein E codesfor a protein involved in transporting lipids into neuronsAPOE occurs in at least three forms alleles calledAPOE e APOE e and APOE e Each person inheritsone APOE from each parent and therefore can eitherhave one copy of two different forms or two copies ofone The relatively rare APOE e appears to protect somepeople from AD as it seems to be associated with alower risk of AD and a later age of onset if AD doesdevelop APOE e is the most common version found inthe general population and only appears to have a neutral role in AD However APOE e appears to increasethe risk of developing late onset AD with the inheritanceof one or two copies of APOE e Compared to thosewithout APOE e people with one copy are about threetimes as likely to develop lateonset AD and those withtwo copies are almost four times as likely to do so Having APOE e can also lower the age of onset by as muchas years However APOE e only increases the risk ofdeveloping AD and does not cause it as not everyonewith APOE e develops AD and people without it canstill have the disease Why APOE e increases thechances of developing AD is not known with certaintyHowever one theory is that APOE e facilitates betaamyloid buildup in plaques thus contributing to the lowering of the age of onset of AD other theories involveinteractions with cholesterol levels and effects on nerve GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Alzheimers diseaseGEM to A PM Page cell death independent of its effects on plaque buildup In four new ADrelated regions in the human genomewere identified where one out of several hundred genesin each of these regions may be a risk factor gene for ADThese genes which are not yet identified appear to makea contribution to the risk of developing lateonset ADthat is at least as important as APOE e Other nongenetic factors have also been studied in relation to the causes of AD Inflammation of the brainmay play a role in development of AD and use of nons teroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs seems to reduce the risk of developing AD Restriction of bloodflow may be part of the problem perhaps accounting forthe beneficial effects of estrogen which increases bloodflow in the brain among its other effects Highly reactivemolecular fragments called free radicals damage cells ofall kinds especially brain cells which have smaller supplies of protective antioxidants thought to protect againstfree radical damage Vitamin E is one such antioxidantand its use in AD may be of possible theoretical benefit While the ultimate cause or causes of Alzheimers disease are still unknown there are several risk factorsthat increase a persons likelihood of developing the disease The most significant one is of course age olderpeople develop AD at much higher rates than youngerones There is some evidence that strokes and AD may belinked with small strokes that go undetected clinicallycontributing to the injury of neurons Blood cholesterollevels may also be important Scientists have shown thathigh blood cholesterol levels in special breeds of genetically engineered transgenic mice may increase the rateof plaque deposition There are also parallels betweenAD and other progressive neurodegenerative disordersthat cause dementia including prion diseases Parkinsons disease and Huntingtons disease Numerous epidemiological studies of populations are also being conducted to learn more about whether and towhat extent early life events socioeconomic factors andethnicity have an impact on the development of AD Forexample results from one study indicated that rural residence in childhood along with fewer than six years ofschooling was associated with increased AD risk However the low educational attainment that was identified asa risk factor might be a marker or surrogate for other deleterious socioeconomic or environmental influences inchildhood thus illustrating the difficulties in interpretingepidemiological findings due to the complexity of theissues and the large number of variables involved Many environmental factors have been suspected of contributing to AD but epidemiological population studies have not borne out these links Among these havebeen pollutants in drinking water aluminum from commercial products and metal dental fillings To date none of these factors has been shown to cause AD or increaseits likelihood Further research may yet turn up links toother environmental factors Symptoms The symptoms of Alzheimers disease begin gradu ally usually with memory lapses Occasional memorylapses are of course common to everyone and do not bythemselves signify any change in cognitive function Theperson with AD may begin with only the routine sort ofmemory lapseforgetting where the car keys arebutprogress to more profound or disturbing losses such asforgetting that he or she can even drive a car Becominglost or disoriented on a walk around the neighborhoodbecomes more likely as the disease progresses A personwith AD may forget the names of family members orforget what was said at the beginning of a sentence bythe time he hears the end As AD progresses other symptoms appear includ ing inability to perform routine tasks loss of judgmentand personality or behavior changes Some patients havetrouble sleeping and may suffer from confusion or agitation in the evening sunsetting or Sundowners Syndrome In some cases people with AD repeat the sameideas movements words or thoughts a behavior knownas perseveration In the final stages people may havesevere problems with eating communicating and controlling their bladder and bowel functions The Alzheimers Association has developed a list of ten warning signs of AD A person with several of these symptoms should see a physician for a thorough evaluation memory loss that affects job skills difficulty performing familiar tasks problems with language disorientation of time and place poor or decreased judgment problems with abstract thinking misplacing things changes in mood or behavior changes in personality loss of initiative Other types of dementia including some that are reversible can cause similar symptoms It is important forthe person with these symptoms to be evaluated by a professional who can weigh the possibility that his or hersymptoms may have another cause Approximately ofthose originally suspected of having AD turn out to havesome other disorder about half of these cases are treatable GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Alzheimers diseaseGEM to A PM Page Diagnosis Diagnosis of Alzheimers disease is complex and may require office visits to several different specialistsover several months before a diagnosis can be madeWhile a confident provisional diagnosis may be made inmost cases after thorough testing AD cannot be definitively diagnosed until autopsy examination of the brainfor plaques and neurofibrillary tangles The diagnosis of AD begins with a thorough physi cal exam and complete medical history Except in thediseases earliest stages accurate history from familymembers or caregivers is essential Since there are bothprescription and overthecounter drugs that can causethe same mental changes as AD a careful review of thepatients drug medicine and alcohol use is importantADlike symptoms can also be provoked by other medical conditions including tumors infection and dementia caused by mild strokes multiinfarct dementiaThese possibilities must be ruled out as well throughappropriate blood and urine tests brain magnetic reso nance imaging MRI positron emission tomography PET or single photon emission computed tomography SPECT scans tests of the brains electrical activityelectroencephalographs or EEGs or other tests Severaltypes of oral and written tests are used to aid in the ADdiagnosis and to follow its progression including tests ofmental status functional abilities memory and concentration Still the neurologic exam is normal in most patients in early stages One of the most important parts of the diagnostic process is to evaluate the patient for depression anddelirium since each of these can be present with AD or may be mistaken for it Delirium involves adecreased consciousness or awareness of ones environment Depression and memory loss are both commonin the elderly and the combination of the two can oftenbe mistaken for AD Depression can be treated withdrugs although some antidepressants can worsendementia if it is present further complicating both diagnosis and treatment An early and accurate diagnosis of AD is important in developing strategies for managing symptoms and forhelping patients and their families planning for the futureand pursuing care options while the patient can still takepart in the decisionmaking process A genetic test for the APOE e gene is available but is not used for diagnosis since possessing even twocopies does not ensure that a person will develop AD Inaddition access to genetic information could affect theinsurability of a patient if disclosed and also affectemployment status and legal rightsTreatment Alzheimers disease is presently incurable so there fore the mainstay of treatment for a person with AD isgood nursing care providing both physical and emotional support for a person who is gradually able to do lessand less for himself and whose behavior is becomingmore and more erratic Modifications of the home toincrease safety and security are often necessary Thecaregiver also needs support to prevent anger despairand burnout from becoming overwhelming Becomingfamiliar with the issues likely to lie ahead and considering the appropriate financial and legal issues early oncan help both the patient and family cope with the difficult process of the disease Regular medical care by apractitioner with a nondefeatist attitude toward AD isimportant so that illnesses such as urinary or respiratoryinfections can be diagnosed and treated properly ratherthan being incorrectly attributed to the inevitable declineseen in AD People with AD are also often depressed or anxious and may suffer from sleeplessness poor nutrition and general poor health Each of these conditions is treatableto some degree It is important for the person with AD toeat well and continue to exercise Professional advicefrom a nutritionist may be useful to provide healthyeasytoprepare meals Finger foods may be preferable tothose requiring utensils to be eaten Regular exercisesupervised if necessary for safety promotes overallhealth A calm structured environment with simple orientation aids such as calendars and clocks may reduceanxiety and increase safety Other psychiatric symptoms such as

only three drugstacrine Cognex donepezil hydrochloride Aricept and rivastigmineExelonhave been approved by the FDA for its treatment Tacrine has been shown to be effective for improving memory skills but only in patients with mildtomoderate AD and even then in less than half of those who takeit Its beneficial effects are usually mild and temporary butit may delay the need for nursing home admission Themost significant side effect is an increase in a liver enzymeknown as alanine aminotransferase or ALT Patients taking tacrine must have a weekly blood test to monitor theirALT levels Other frequent side effects include nauseavomiting diarrhea abdominal pain indigestion and skin rash The cost of tacrine was about per month inearly with additional costs for the weekly bloodmonitoring Despite its high cost tacrine appears to becosteffective for those who respond to it since it maydecrease the number of months a patient needs nursingcare Donepezil is the drug most commonly used to treatmild to moderate symptoms of AD although it only helpssome patients for periods of time ranging from months toabout two years Donepezil has two advantages overtacrine it has fewer side effects and it can be given oncedaily rather than three times daily Donepezil does notappear to affect liver enzymes and therefore does notrequire weekly blood tests The frequency of abdominalside effects is also lower The monthly cost is approximately the same Rivastigmine approved for use in Aprilof has been shown to improve the ability of patientsto carry out daily activities such as eating and dressingdecrease behavioral symptoms such as delusions and agitation and improve cognitive functions such as thinkingmemory and speaking The cost is similar to those of theother two drugs However none of these three drugs stopsor reverses the progression of AD Estrogen the female sex hormone is widely pre scribed for postmenopausal women to prevent osteo porosis Several preliminary studies have shown that women taking estrogen have lower rates of AD and thosewho develop AD have a slower progression and lesssevere symptomsHowever estrogen does not appear tohave a beneficial effect on women who already have AD Preliminary studies have also suggested a reduced risk for developing AD in older people who regularly usenonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs including aspirin ibuprofen and naproxen although not aceta minophenInflammation of the brain is a distinctive characteristic of AD but whether it is a cause or an effect ofthe disease is not yet known Antioxidants which act to inhibit and protect against oxidative damage caused by free radicals havebeen shown to inhibit toxic effects of betaamyloid in tis sue culture Therefore research is being conducted to seewhether antioxidants may delay or prevent AD Another antioxidant vitamin E is also thought to delay AD onset It is not yet clear whether this is due tothe specific action of vitamin E on brain cells or to anincrease in the overall health of those taking it Drugs such as antidepressants antipsychotics and sedatives are used to treat the behavioral symptomsagitation aggression wandering and sleep disorders of AD Research is being conducted to search for bettertreatments including nondrug approaches for ADpatients Nursing care and safety The person with Alzheimers disease will gradually lose the ability to dress groom feed bathe or use thetoilet by himself in the later stages of the disease hemay be unable to move or speak In addition the persons behavior becomes increasing erratic A tendency towander may make it difficult to leave him unattended foreven a few minutes and make even the home a potentiallydangerous place In addition some patients may exhibitinappropriate sexual behaviors The nursing care required for a person with AD is well within the abilities of most people to learn The difficulty for many caregivers comes in the constant butunpredictable nature of the demands put on them Inaddition the personality changes undergone by a personwith AD can be heartbreaking for family members as aloved one deteriorates seeming to become a differentperson Not all AD patients develop negative behaviorssome become quite gentle and spend increasing amountsof time in dreamlike states A loss of good grooming may be one of the early symptoms of AD Mismatched clothing unkempt hairand decreased interest in personal hygiene become morecommon Caregivers especially spouses may find thesechanges socially embarrassing and difficult to cope withThe caregiver will usually need to spend increasingamounts of time for grooming to compensate for the lossof attention from the patient although some adjustmentof expectations while maintaining cleanliness is oftenneeded as the disease progresses Proper nutrition is important for a person with AD and may require assisted feeding early on to make sure theperson is taking in enough nutrients Later on as movement and swallowing become difficult a feeding tube maybe placed into the stomach through the abdominal wall Afeeding tube requires more attention but is generally easyto care for if the patient is not resistant to its use GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Alzheimers diseaseGEM to A PM Page For many caregivers incontinence becomes the most difficult problem to deal with at home and is aprincipal reason for pursuing nursing home care In theearly stages limiting fluid intake and increasing the frequency of toileting can help Careful attention to hygieneis important to prevent skin irritation and infection fromsoiled clothing Persons with dementia must deal with six basic safe ty concerns injury from falls injury from ingesting dangerous substances leaving the home and getting lostinjury to self or others from sharp objects fire or burns and the inability to respond rapidly to crisis situations Inall cases a person diagnosed with AD should no longerbe allowed to drive because of the increased potentialfor accidents and the increased likelihood of wanderingvery far from home while disoriented In the home simple measures such as grab bars in the bathroom bed railson the bed and easily negotiable passageways can greatly increase safety Electrical appliances should beunplugged and put away when not in use and matcheslighters knives or weapons should be stored safely outof reach The hot water heater temperature may be setlower to prevent accidental scalding A list of emergencynumbers including the poison control center and thehospital emergency room should be posted by thephone As the disease progresses caregivers need to periodically reevaluate the physical safety of the home andintroduce new strategies for continued safety Care for the caregiver Family members or others caring for a person with AD have an extremely difficult and stressful job whichbecomes harder as the disease progresses Dementiacaregivers spend significantly more time on caregivingthan do people providing care for those with other typesof illnesses This type of caregiving also has a greaterimpact in terms of employment complications caregiverstrain mental and physical health problems time forleisure and other family members and family conflictthan do other types of caregiving It is common for ADcaregivers to develop feelings of anger resentment guiltand

available through local social service agencies Adult daycare facilities are becoming increasinglycommon Meal delivery shopping assistance or respitecare may be available as well Providing the total care required by a person with latestage AD can become an overwhelming burden for afamily even with outside help At this stage many families consider nursing home care This decision is often oneof the most difficult for the family since it is often seen asan abandonment of the loved one and a failure of the family Careful counseling with a sympathetic physician clergy or other trusted adviser may ease the difficulties of thistransition Selecting a nursing home may require a difficultbalancing of cost services location and availabilityKeeping the entire family involved in the decision mayhelp prevent further stress from developing later on Several federal government programs may ease the cost of caring for a person with AD including SocialSecurity Disability Medicare and Supplemental

both eyes with no apparent structural abnormalityseen to explain it It is a diagnosis of exclusion meaningthat when a decrease in vision is detected other causesmust be ruled out Once no other cause is found amblyopia is the diagnosis Generally a difference of two linesor more on an eyechart test of visual acuity betweenthe two eyes or a best corrected vision of or worsewould be defined as amblyopia For example if someonehas vision with the right eye and only withthe left and the left eye cannot achieve better vision withcorrective lenses the left eye is said to be amblyopic Description Lazy eye is a common nonmedical term used to describe amblyopia because the eye with poorer visiondoesnt seem to be doing its job of seeing Amblyopia isthe most common cause of impaired vision in childrenaffecting nearly three out of every people or of the population Vision is a combination of the clarityof the images of the eyes visual acuity and the processing of those images by the brain If the images producedby the two eyes are substantially different the brain maynot be able to fuse the images Instead of seeing two different images or double vision diplopia the brain suppresses the blurrier image This suppression can lead toamblyopia During the first few years of life preferringone eye over the other may lead to poor visual development in the blurrier eye Causes and symptoms Some of the major causes of amblyopia are as followsStrabismus A misalignment of the eyes strabismus is the most common cause of functional amblyopia Thetwo eyes are looking in two different directions at thesame time The brain is sent two different images andthis causes confusion Images from the misaligned orcrossed eye are turned off to avoid double vision Anisometropia This is another type of functional amblyopia In this case there is a difference of refractive states between the two eyes in other words a difference of prescriptions between the two eyes Forexample one eye may be more nearsighted than theother eye or one eye may be farsighted and the othereye nearsighted Because the brain cannot fuse the twodissimilar images the brain will suppress the blurrierimage causing the eye to become amblyopic Cataract Clouding of the lens of the eye will cause the image to be blurrier than the other eye The brainprefers the clearer image The eye with the cataractmay become amblyopic Ptosis This is the drooping of the upper eyelid If light cannot enter the eye because of the drooping lid theeye is essentially not being used This can lead toamblyopia Nutrition A type of organic amblyopia in which nutri tional deficiencies or chemical toxicity may result inamblyopia Alcohol tobacco or a deficiency in the Bvitamins may result in toxic amblyopia Heredity Amblyopia can run in families Barring the presence of strabismus or ptosis chil dren may or may not show signs of amblyopia Childrenmay hold their heads at an angle while trying to favor theeye with normal vision

Custom Medical Stock Photo Repro duced by permissionGEM to A PM Page approach is preferred by the child or infant If an infants good eye is covered the child may cry Diagnosis Because children with outwardly normal eyes may have amblyopia it is important to have regular visionscreenings performed for all children While there issome controversy regarding the age children should havetheir first vision examination their eyes can in actualitybe examined at any age even at one day of life Some recommend that children have their vision checked by their pediatrician family physician ophthalmologist or optometrist at or before six months of ageOthers recommend testing by at least the childs fourthbirthday There may be a critical period in the development of vision and amblyopia may not be treatable afterage eight or nine The earlier amblyopia is found the betterthe possible outcome Most physicians test vision as part ofa childs medical examination If there is any sign of an eyeproblem they may refer a child to an eye specialist There are objective methods such as retinoscopy to measure the refractive status of the eyes This can helpdetermine anisometropia In retinoscopy a handheldinstrument is used to shine a light in the childs orinfants eyes Using handheld lenses a rough prescription can be obtained Visual acuity can be determinedusing a variety of methods Many different eye charts areavailable eg tumbling E pictures or letters In amblyopia single letters are easier to recognize than when aKEY TERMS Anisometropia An eye condition in which there is an inequality of vision between the two eyesThere may be unequal amounts of nearsightedness farsightedness or astigmatism so that oneeye will be in focus while the other will not Cataract Cloudiness of the eyes natural lens Occulsion therapy A type of treatment for ambly opia in which the good eye is patched for a periodof time This forces the weaker eye to be used Strabismus A condition in which the eyes are misaligned and point in different directions Oneeye may look straight ahead while the other turnsinward outward upward or downward This isalso called crossedeyes Visual acuity Acuity is the acuteness or sharp ness of visionwhole line is shown This is called the crowding effect and helps in diagnosing amblyopia Neutral density filtersmay also be held over the eye to aid in the diagnosisSometimes visual fields to determine defects in the areaof vision will be performed Color vision testing may alsobe performed Again it must be emphasized that amblyopia is a diagnosis of exclusion Visual or lifethreateningproblems can also cause a decrease in vision An examination of the eyes and visual system is very importantwhen there is an unexplained decrease in vision Treatment The primary treatment for amblyopia is occlusion therapy It is important to alternate patching the good eyeforcing the amblyopic eye to work and the amblyopiceye If the good eye is constantly patched it too maybecome amblyopic because of disuse The treatment planshould be discussed with the doctor to fully understandhow long the patch will be on When patched eye exercises may be prescribed to force the amblyopic eye to focusand work This is called vision therapy or vision training eye exercises Even after vision has been restored in theweak eye parttime patching may be required over a period of years to maintain the improvement While patching is necessary to get the amblyopic eye to work it is just as important to correct the reasonfor the amblyopia Glasses may also be worn if there areerrors in refraction Surgery or vision training may benecessary in the case of strabismus Better nutrition isindicated in some toxic amblyopias Occasionallyamblyopia is treated by blurring the vision in the goodeye with eye drops or lenses to force the child to use theamblyopic eye Prognosis The younger the person the better the chance for improvement with occlusion and vision therapy However treatment may be successful in older childrenevenadults Success in the treatment of amblyopia alsodepends upon how severe the amblyopia is the specifictype of amblyopia and patient compliance

by a para sitic onecelled microorganism protozoan called Enta moeba histolytica Persons with amebiasis may experi ence a wide range of symptoms including diarrhea fever and cramps The disease may also affect the intestines liver or other parts of the body Description Amebiasis also known as amebic dysentery is one of the most common parasitic diseases occurring inhumans with an estimated million new cases eachyear It occurs most frequently in tropical and subtropicalareas where living conditions are crowded with inadequate sanitation Although most cases of amebiasis occurin persons who carry the disease but do not exhibit anysymptoms asymptomatic as many as peopledie of amebiasis each year In the United States between and of the general population will develop amebiasis in any given year while male homosexuals migrantworkers institutionalized people and recent immigrantsdevelop amebiasis at a higher rate Human beings are the only known host of the amebi asis organism and all groups of people regardless of ageor sex can become affected Amebiasis is primarilyspread in food and water that has been contaminated byhuman feces but is also spread by persontoperson contact The number of cases is typically limited but regional outbreaks can occur in areas where human feces areused as fertilizer for crops or in cities with water supplies contaminated with human fecesCauses and symptoms Recently it has been discovered that persons with symptomcausing amebiasis are infected with Entamoe ba histolytica and those individuals who exhibit no symptoms are actually infected with an almost identicallooking ameba called Entamoeba dispar During their life cycles the amebas exist in two very different formsthe infective cyst or capsuled form which cannot movebut can survive outside the human body because of itsprotective covering and the diseaseproducing form thetrophozoite which although capable of moving cannotsurvive once excreted in the feces and therefore cannotinfect others The disease is most commonly transmittedwhen a person eats food or drinks water containing E histolytica cysts from human feces In the digestive tract the cysts are transported to the intestine where the wallsof the cysts are broken open by digestive secretionsreleasing the mobile trophozoites Once released withinthe intestine the trophozoites multiply by feeding onintestinal bacteria or by invading the lining of the largeintestine Within the lining of the large intestine thetrophozoites secrete a substance that destroys intestinaltissue and creates a distinctive bottleshaped sore ulcerThe trophozoites may remain inside the intestine in theintestinal wall or may break through the intestinal walland be carried by the blood to the liver lungs brain orother organs Trophozoites that remain in the intestineseventually form new cysts that are carried through thedigestive tract and excreted in the feces Under favorabletemperature and humidity conditions the cysts can survive in soil or water for weeks to months ready to beginthe cycle again Although of cases of amebiasis in the United States are mild pregnant women children under twoyears of age the elderly malnourished

ulceration to the intestinal wallPhoto Researchers Inc Reproduced by permissionGEM to A PM Page people whose immune systems may be compressed such as cancer or AIDS patients and those individuals taking prescription medications that suppress the immune system are at a greater risk for developing a severe infection The signs and symptoms of amebiasis vary accord ing to the location and severity of the infection and areclassified as follows Intestinal amebiasis Intestinal amebiasis can be subdivided into several categories ASYMPTOMATIC INFECTION Most persons with amebiasis have no noticeable symptoms Even thoughthese individuals may not feel ill they are still capable ofinfecting others by persontoperson contact or by contaminating food or water with cysts that others may ingestfor example by preparing food with unwashed hands CHRONIC NONDYSENTERIC INFECTION Individu als may experience symptoms over a long period of timeduring a chronic amebiasis infection and experiencerecurrent episodes of diarrhea that last from one to fourweeks and recur over a period of years These patientsmay also suffer from abdominal cramps fatigue and weight loss AMEBIC DYSENTERY In severe cases of intestinal amebiasis the organism invades the lining of the intestine producing sores ulcers bloody diarrhea severeabdominal cramps vomiting chills and fevers as high asF C In addition a case of acute amebic dysentery may cause complications includinginflammation of the appendix appendicitis a tear in the intestinal wall perforation or a sudden severeinflammation of the colon fulminating colitis AMEBOMA An ameboma is a mass of tissue in the bowel that is formed by the amebiasis organism It canresult from either chronic intestinal infection or acuteamebic dysentery Amebomas may produce symptomsthat mimic cancer or other intestinal diseases PERIANAL ULCERS Intestinal amebiasis may pro duce skin infections in the area around the patients anusperianal These ulcerated areas have a punchedoutappearance and are painful to the touch Extraintestinal amebiasis Extraintestinal amebiasis accounts for approximate ly of all reported amebiasis cases and includes allforms of the disease that affect other organs The most common form of extraintestinal amebiasis is amebic abscess of the liver In the United States amebic liver abscesses occur most frequently in young His panic adults An amebic liver abscess can result fromdirect infection of the liver by E histolytica or as a com plication of intestinal amebiasis Patients with an amebicabscess of the liver complain of pain in the chest or abdomen fever nausea and tenderness on the right sidedirectly above the liver Other forms of extraintestinal amebiasis though rare include infections of the lungs chest cavity brainor genitals These are extremely serious and have a relatively high mortality rate Diagnosis Diagnosis of amebiasis is complicated partly because the disease can affect several areas of the bodyand can range from exhibiting few if any symptoms tobeing severe or even lifethreatening In most cases aphysician will consider a diagnosis of amebiasis when apatient has a combination of symptoms in particulardiarrhea and a possible history of recent exposure toamebiasis through travel contact with infected personsor anal intercourse It is vital to distinguish between amebiasis and another disease inflammatory bowel disease IBD thatproduces similar symptoms because if diagnosed incorrectly drugs that are given to treat IBD can encourage thegrowth and spread of the amebiasis organism Because ofthe serious consequences of misdiagnosis potential casesof IBD must be confirmed with multiple stool samplesand blood tests and a procedure involving a visualinspection of the intestinal wall using a thin lighted tubular instrument sigmoidoscopy to rule out amebiasis A diagnosis of amebiasis may be confirmed by one or more tests depending on the location of the disease Stool examination This test involves microscopically examining a stool sample for the presence of cysts andor trophozoites of E histolytica and not one of the many other intestinal ame bas that are often found but that do not cause disease Aseries of three stool tests is approximately accuratein confirming a diagnosis of amebic dysentery Unfortunately however the stool test is not useful in diagnosingamebomas or extraintestinal infections Sigmoidoscopy Sigmoidoscopy is a useful diagnostic procedure in which a thin flexible lighted instrument called a sigmoidoscope is used to visually examine the lower part ofthe large intestine for amebic ulcers and take tissue orfluid samples from the intestinal lining GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AmebiasisGEM to A PM Page Blood tests Although tests designed to detect a specific protein produced in response to amebiasis infection antibody arecapable of detecting only about of cases of mild amebiasis these tests are extremely useful in confirming of dysentery diagnoses and of liver abscess diagnoses Blood serum will usually test positive for antibodywithin a week of symptom onset Blood testing howevercannot always distinguish between a current or past infection since the antibodies may be detectable in the blood foras long as years following initial infection Imaging studies A number of sophisticated imaging techniques such as computed tomography scans CT magnetic reso nance imaging MRI and ultrasound can be used to determine whether a liver abscess is present Once located a physician may then use a fine needle to withdraw asample of tissue to determine whether the abscess isindeed caused by an amebic infection Treatment Asymptomatic or mild cases of amebiasis may require no treatment However because of the potentialfor disease spread amebiasis is generally treated with amedication to kill the diseasecausing amebas Moresevere cases of amebic dysentery are additionally treatedby replacing lost fluid and blood Patients with an amebic liver abscess will also require hospitalization and bedrest For those cases of extraintestinal amebiasis treatment can be complicated because different drugs may berequired to eliminate the parasite based on the locationof the infection within the body Drugs used to treat amebiasis called amebicides are divided into two categories Luminal amebicides These drugs get their name because they act on organisms within the inner cavity lumen of the bowelThey include diloxanide furoate iodoquinol metronidazole and paromomycin Tissue amebicides Tissue amebicides are used to treat infections in the liver and other body tissues and include emetine dehydroemetine metronidazole and chloroquine Becausethese drugs have potentially serious side effects

aperiod by the age of Secondary amenorrhea is morecommon and refers to either the temporary or permanentending of periods in a woman who has menstruated normally in the past Many women miss a period occasionally Amenorrhea occurs if a woman misses three or moreperiods in a row Description The absence of menstrual periods is a symptom not a disease While the average age that menstruation beginsis the range varies The incidence of primary amenorrhea in the United States is just Some female athletes who participate in rowing long distance running and cycling may notice a fewmissed periods Women athletes at a particular risk fordeveloping amenorrhea include ballerinas and gymnastswho typically exercise strenuously and eat poorly Causes and symptoms Amenorrhea can have many causes Primary amenor rhea can be the result of hormonal imbalances psychiatric disorders eating disorders malnutrition excessive thinness or fatness rapid weight loss body fat content toolow and excessive physical conditioning Intense physicaltraining prior to puberty can delay menarche the onset of menstruation Every year of training can delay menarche for up to five months Some medications such as antidepressants tranquilizers steroids and heroin can induceamenorrhea Primary amenorrhea However the main cause is a delay in the beginning of puberty either from natural reasons such as heredity orpoor nutrition or because of a problem in the endocrine system such as a pituitary tumor or hypothyroidism An obstructed flow tract or inflammation in the uterus maybe the presenting indications of an underlying metabolicendocrine congenital or gynecological disorder Typical causes of primary amenorrhea include excessive physical activity drastic weight loss such as occurs in anorexia or bulimia extreme obesity drugs antidepressants or tranquilizers chronic illness turners syndrome A chromosomal problem in place at birth relevant only in cases of primary amenorrhea the absence of a vagina or a uterus GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AmenorrheaGEM to A PM Page imperforate hymen lack of an opening to allow the menstrual blood through Secondary amenorrhea Some of the causes of primary amenorrhea can also cause secondary amenorrheastrenuous physical activity excessive weight loss use of antidepressants or tranquilizers in particular In adolescents pregnancy and stress are two major causes Missed periods are usually caused in adolescents by stress and changes in environment Adolescents are especially prone to irregular periods with fevers weight loss changes in environment orincreased physical or athletic activity However any cessation of periods for four months should be evaluated The most common cause of seconardy amenorrhea is pregnancy Also a womans periods may halt temporarilyafter she stops taking birth control pills This temporaryhalt usually lasts only for a month or two though in somecases it can last for a year or more Secondary amenorrhea may also be related to hormonal problems related tostress depression anorexia nervosa or drugs or it may be caused by any condition affecting the ovaries such as atumor The cessation of menstruation also occurs permanently after menopause or a hysterectomy Polycystic ovary syndrome is another common cause of secondary amenorrhea It is caused by ovaries containing many fluid filled sacs cysts with abnormal levels ofmale hormones androgens This condition is related toimproper functioning of the pituitary gland as it releaseshormones necessary for pregnancy leuteinizing hormones and can cause women to develop male characteristics such as acne and coarse body hair If the condition is not treated some of the androgens may convert to estrogenand chronically high levels of estrogen may increase thechance of developing cancer of the uterine lining Diagnosis It may be difficult to find the cause of amenorrhea but the exam should start with a pregnancy test pregnancy needs to be ruled out whenever a womans period istwo to three weeks overdue Androgen excess estrogendeficiency or other problems with the endocrine systemneed to be checked Prolactin in the blood and the thyroid stimulating hormone TSH should also be checked The diagnosis usually includes a patient history and a physical exam including a pelvic exam If a woman has missed three or more periods in a row a physicianmay recommend blood tests to measure hormone levelsa scan of the skull to rule out the possibility of a pituitarytumor and ultrasound scans of the abdomen and pelvis torule out a tumor of the adrenal gland or ovaryTreatment Treatment of amenorrhea depends on the cause Pri mary amenorrhea often requires no treatment but itsalways important to discover the cause of the problem inany case Not all conditions can be treated but anyunderlying condition that is treatable should be treated If a hormonal imbalance is the problem proges terone for one to two weeks every month or two may correct the problem With polycystic ovary syndrome birthcontrol pills are often prescribed A pituitary tumor istreated with bromocriptine a drug that reduces certainhormone prolactin secretions Weight loss may bringon a period in an obese woman Easing up on excessiveexercise and eating a proper diet may bring on periods inteen athletes In very rare cases surgery may be neededfor women with ovarian or uterine cysts Prognosis Prolonged amenorrhea can lead to infertility and other medical problems such as osteoporosis thinning of the bones If the halt in the normal period is caused by stressor illness periods should begin again when the stress passes or the illness is treated Amenorrhea that occurs with discontinuing birth control pills usually go away within six toeight weeks although it may take up to a year The prognosis for polycystic ovary disease depends on the severity of the symptoms and the treatment planSpironolactone a drug that blocks the production ofmale hormones can help in reducing body hair If awoman wishes to become pregnant treatment withclomiphene may be required or on rare occasionssurgery on the ovaries Prevention Primary amenorrhea caused by a congenital condi tion cannot be prevented In general however womenshould maintain a healthy diet with plenty of exerciserest and not too much stress avoiding smoking and sub stance abuse Female athletes should be sure

causemental retardation that can prevented with prompt treatment of the newborn One of the best known examples of this is phenylketonuria PKU This is an genetic error in metabolism of phenylalanine an amino acidfound in milk Individuals with PKU do not produce theenzyme necessary to break down phenylalanine PKU occurs in about one out of live births in the United States but is more prevalent in caucasians andless prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews and African AmericansNewborns in the United States are routinely screened forPKU by a blood test There are two types of aminoacidurias Primary or overflow aminoaciduria results from deficiencies in theenzymes necessary to metabolize amino acids Overflowaminoaciduria is best detected by a blood plasma test Secondary or renal aminoaciduria occurs because of a congenital defect in the amino acid transport system inthe tubules of the kidneys This produces increasedamino acids in the urine Blood and urine test in combination are used to determine if the aminoaciduria is ofthe overflow or renal type Urine tests are also used tomonitor specific amino acid disorders Newborns are screened for amino acid disorders Young children with acidosis accumulation of acid inthe body severe vomiting and diarrhea or urine with an abnormal color or odor are also screened with a urinetest for specific amino acid levels Precautions Both blood and urine

paromomycin streptomycin and tobramycin All of thesedrugs have the same basic chemical structure Purpose Aminoglycosides are primarily used to combat infec tions due to aerobic Gramnegative bacteria These bacteria can be identified by their reaction to Grams stain InGrams staining a film of material containing the possiblebacteria is placed on a glass slide and dried The slide isstained with crystal violet for one minute cleaned off withwater and then placed into a solution of Grams iodinesolution for one minute The iodine solution is rinsed offand the slide is immersed in ethyl alcohol The slide isthen stained again with reddish carbolfuchsin or safraninefor seconds rinsed in water dried and examined Grampositive bacteria retain the violet purple stain Gramnegative bacteria accept the red stain Bacteria that can successfully be combated with aminoglycosides includePseudomonas Acinetobacter and Enterobacter species among others Aminoglycosides are also effective againstmycobacteria the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis The aminoglycosides can be used against certain Grampositive bacteria but are not typically employedbecause other antibiotics are more effective and havefewer side effects Aminoglycosides are ineffectiveagainst anaerobic bacteria bacteria that cannot grow inthe presence of oxygen viruses and fungi And onlyone aminoglycoside paromomycin is used against parasitic infection Like all other antibiotics aminoglycosides are not effective against influenza the common cold or other viral infections Precautions Preexisting medical conditionssuch as kidney dis ease eighth cranial nerve disease myasthenia gravis and Parkinsons diseaseshould be discussed prior to takingany aminoglycosides Pregnant women are usually advisedagainst taking aminoglycosides because their infants maysuffer damage to their hearing kidneys or sense of balance However those factors need to be considered alongside the threat to the mothers health and life in cases ofserious infection Aminoglycosides do not pass into breastmilk to any great extent so nursing mothers may be prescribed aminoglycosides without injuring their infants Description Streptomycin the first aminoglycoside was isolated from Streptomyces griseus in the mids This antibiotic was very effective against tuberculosis One of the main drawbacks to streptomycin is its toxicity especially to cellsin the inner and middle ear and the kidney Furthermoresome strains of tuberculosis are resistant to treatment withstreptomycin Therefore medical researchers have put considerable effort into identifying other antibiotics with streptomycins efficacy but without its toxicity Aminoglycosides are absorbed very poorly from the gastrointestinal tract in fact aminoglycosides taken orally are excreted virtually unchanged and undiminished inquantity The route of drug administration depends on thetype and location of the infection being treated The typical routes of administration are by intramuscular injection into a muscle or intravenous injection injection intoa vein irrigation topical skin application or inhalationIf the infection being treated involves the central nervoussystem the drug can be injected into the spinal canal The bactericidal ability of aminoglycosides has not been fully explained It is known that the drug attaches toa bacterial cell wall and is drawn into the cell via channels made up of the protein porin Once inside the cellthe aminoglycoside attaches to the cells ribosomesRibosomes are the intracellular structures responsible formanufacturing proteins This attachment either shutsdown protein production or causes the cell to produceabnormal ineffective proteins The bacterial cell cannotsurvive with this impediment Antibiotic treatment using aminoglycosides may pair the drug with a second type of antibiotic usually abetalactam or vancomycin administered separatelyBetalactams disrupt the integrity of the bacteria cellwall making it more porous The increased porosityallows more of the aminoglycoside into the bacteria cell Traditionally aminoglycosides were administered at even doses given throughout the day It was thought thata steady plasma concentration was necessary to combatinfection However this administration schedule is timeand labor intensive Furthermore administering a singledaily dose can be as effective or more effective thanseveral doses throughout the day Dosage depends on the patients age weight gender and general health Since the drug is cleared by the kidneys it is important to assess any underlying problemswith kidney function Kidney function is assessed bymeasuring the blood levels of creatinine a protein normally found in the body If these levels are high it is anindication that the kidneys may not be functioning at anoptimal rate and dosage will be lowered accordingly Risks Aminoglycosides have been shown to be toxic to cer tain cells in the ears and in the kidneys Approximately GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Aminoglycosides GEM to A PM Page of the people who are treated with aminoglycosides experience some side effect affecting their hearing senseof balance or kidneys However in most cases the damage is minor and reversible once medication is stopped If cells in the inner ear are damaged or destroyed an individual may experience a loss of

gentamicin carry thegreatest risk of causing vertigo and loss of balance Kidney damage apparent with changes in urination frequency or urine production is most likely precipitated byneomycin tobramycin and gentamicin Young children and the elderly are at the greatest risk of suffering side effects Excessive dosage or poorclearance of the drug from the body can be injurious atany age Less common side effects include skin rashes and itching Very rarely certain aminoglycosides may cause difficulty in breathing weakness or drowsiness Gentamicin when injected may cause leg cramps skin

lucidand retain their sense of self They may even be awarethat they suffer from a memory disorder People who experience amnesia have been instrumen tal in helping brain researchers determine how the brainprocesses memory Until the early s researchersviewed memory as a single entity Memory of new experiences motor skills past events and previous conditioningwere grouped together in one system that relied on a specific area of the brain If all memory were stored in the same way it would be reasonable to deduce that damage to the specific brainarea would cause complete memory loss However studies of amnesiacs counter that theory Such researchdemonstrates that the brain has multiple systems for processing storing and drawing on memory Causes and symptoms Amnesia has several root causes Most are traceable to brain injury related to physical trauma disease infection drug and alcohol abuse or reduced blood flow to the brain vascular insufficiency In WernickeKorsakoffsyndrome for example damage to the memory centersof the brain results from the use of alcohol or malnutri tion Infections that damage brain tissue including encephalitis and herpes can also cause amnesia If the amnesia is thought to be of psychological origin it istermed psychogenic There are at least three general types of amnesia Anterograde This form of amnesia follows brain trau ma and is characterized by the inability to remembernew information Recent experiences and shorttermmemory disappear but victims can recall events priorto the trauma with clarity Retrograde In some ways this form of amnesia is the opposite of anterograde amnesia the victim can recallevents that occurred after a trauma but cannot remember previously familiar information or the events preceding the trauma Transient global amnesia This type of amnesia has no consistently identifiable cause but researchers havesuggested that migraines or transient ischemic attacksmay be the trigger A transient ischemic attack sometimes called a small stroke occurs when ablockage in an artery temporarily blocks off blood supply to part of the brain A victim experiences suddenconfusion and forgetfulness Attacks can be as brief as minutes or can last up to hours In severeattacks a person is completely disoriented and mayexperience retrograde amnesia that extends back several years While very frightening for the patient transient global amnesia generally has an excellent prognosis for recovery Diagnosis In diagnosing amnesia and its cause doctors look at several factors During a physical examination the doc tor inquires about recent traumas or illnesses drug andmedication history and checks the patients generalhealth Psychological exams may be ordered to determine the extent of amnesia and the memory systemaffected The doctor may also order imaging tests such asmagnetic resonance imaging MRI to reveal whether the brain has been damaged and blood work to excludetreatable metabolic causes or chemical imbalances Treatment

relatively normal livesAmnesiacs can learn through therapy to rely on othermemory systems to compensate for what is lost Prevention Amnesia is only preventable in so far as brain injury can be prevented or minimized Common sense approaches include wearing a helmet when bicycling or participating in potentially dangerous sports using automobile seatbelts and avoiding excessive alcohol or

Amniocentesis is a procedure used to diagnose fetal defects in the early second trimester of pregnancy A sample of the amniotic fluid which surrounds a fetus inthe womb is collected through a pregnant womansabdomen using a needle and syringe Tests performed onfetal cells found in the sample can reveal the presence ofmany types of genetic disorders thus allowing doctorsand prospective parents to make important decisionsabout early treatment and intervention GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AmniocentesisGEM to A PM Page Purpose Since the mids amniocentesis has been used routinely to test for Down syndrome by far the most common nonhereditary genetic birth defect afflictingabout one in every babies By approximately different diagnostic tests were available most ofthem for hereditary genetic disorders such as TaySachs disease sickle cell anemia hemophilia muscular dys trophy and cystic fibrosis Amniocentesis often called amnio is recommended for women who will be older than on their duedate Itis also recommended for women who have already bornechildren with birth defects or when either of the parents has a family history of a birth defect for which a diagnostic test is available Another reason for the procedure is toconfirm indications of Down syndrome and certain otherdefects which may have shown up previously during routine maternal blood screening The risk of bearing a child with a nonhereditary genetic defect such as Down syndrome is directly related to a womans agethe older the woman the greaterthe risk Thirtyfive is the recommended age to beginamnio testing because that is the age at which the risk ofcarrying a fetus with such a defect roughly equals therisk of miscarriage caused by the procedureabout one in At age the risk of giving birth to a childwith this type of defect is about one in by age it increases to about one in Nearly half of all pregnant women over in the United States undergoamniocentesis and many younger women also decide tohave the procedure Notably some of all Downsyndrome infants born in the United States each year areto women younger than One of the most common reasons for performing amniocentesis is an abnormal alphafetoprotein AFPtest Alphafetoprotein is a protein produced by the fetusand present in the mothers blood A simple bloodscreening usually conducted around the th week ofpregnancy can determine the AFP levels in the mothersblood Levels that are too high or too low may signalpossible fetal defects Because this test has a high falsepositive rate another test such as amnio is recommendedwhenever the AFP levels fall outside the normal range Amniocentesis is generally performed during the th week of pregnancy with results usually availablewithin three weeks It is possible to perform an amnio asearly as the th week but this is not usually recommended because there appears to be an increased risk of miscarriage when done at this time The advantage of earlyamnio and speedy results lies in the extra time for decision making if a problem is detected Potential treatmentof the fetus can begin earlier Important also is the factthat elective abortions are safer and less controversial the earlier they are performed Precautions As an invasive surgical procedure amnio poses a real although small risk to the health of a fetus Parents mustweigh the potential value of the knowledge gained orindeed the reassurance that all is well against the small riskof damaging what is in all probability a normal fetus Theserious emotional and ethical dilemmas that adverse testresults can bring must also be considered The decision toundergo amnio is always a matter of personal choice Description The word amniocentesis literally means puncture of the amnion the thinwalled sac of fluid in which adeveloping fetus is suspended during pregnancy Duringthe sampling procedure the obstetrician inserts a veryfine needle through the womans abdomen into the uterusand amniotic sac and withdraws approximately oneounce of amniotic fluid for testing The relatively painless procedure is performed on an outpatient basis sometimes using local anesthesia The physician uses ultrasound images to guide nee dle placement and collect the sample thereby minimizing the risk of fetal injury and the need for repeated needle insertions Once the sample is collected the womancan return home after a brief observation period Shemay be instructed to rest for the first hours and toavoid heavy lifting for two days The sample of amniotic fluid is sent to a laboratory where fetal cells contained in the fluid are isolated andgrown in order to provide enough genetic material fortesting This takes about seven to days The material isthen extracted and treated so that visual examination fordefects can be made For some disorders like TaySachsthe simple presence of a telltale chemical compound inthe amniotic fluid is enough to confirm a diagnosisDepending on the specific tests ordered and the skill ofthe lab conducting them all the results are availablebetween one and four weeks after the sample is taken Cost of the procedure depends on the doctor the lab and the tests ordered Most insurers provide coverage forwomen over as a followup to positive maternalblood screening results and when genetic disorders runin the family An alternative to amnio now in general use is chori onic villus sampling or CVS which can be performed as early as the eighth week of pregnancy While this allowsfor the possibility of a first trimester abortion if warranted CVS is apparently also riskier and is more expensive GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AmniocentesisGEM to A PM Page The most promising area of new research in prenatal test ing involves expanding the scope and accuracy of maternal blood screening as this poses no risk to the fetus Preparation It is important for a woman to fully understand the procedure and to feel confident in the obstetrician performing it Evidence suggests that a physicians experience with the procedure reduces the chance of mishapAlmost all obstetricians are experienced in performingamniocentesis The patient should feel free to ask questions and seek emotional support before during and afterthe amnio is performed Aftercare Necessary aftercare falls into two categories physi cal and emotional Physical aftercare During and immediately following the sampling procedure a woman may experience dizziness nausea arapid heartbeat and cramping Once past these immedi ate hurdles the physician will send the woman homewith instructions to rest and to report any complicationsrequiring immediate treatment including vaginal bleeding The appearance of blood could signal a problem premature labor Unusual abdominal pain andor cramping may indicate the onset of premature laborMild cramping for the first day or two following theprocedure is normal signs of infection Leaking of amniotic fluid or unusual vaginal discharge and fever could signal the onset of infection Emotional aftercare Once the procedure has been safely completed the anxiety of waiting for the test results can prove to be the worst part of the process A woman should seek andreceive emotional support from family and friends aswell as from her obstetrician and family doctor Professional counseling may also prove necessary particularlyif a fetal defect is discovered GALE

tissue or relieve pain Purpose Arms legs hands feet fingers and toes can all be amputated Most amputations involve small body partssuch as a finger rather than an entire limb About amputations are performed in the United States each year Amputation is performed for the following reasons to remove tissue that no longer has an adequate blood supply to remove malignant tumors because of severe

emergency procedures Injury and arterial embolisms are the mainreasons for emergency amputations The operation isperformed under regional or general anesthesia by a general or orthopedic surgeon in a hospital operating room Details of the operation vary slightly depending on what part is to be removed The goal of all amputations istwofold to remove diseased tissue so that the wound willheal cleanly and to construct a stump that will allow theattachment of a prosthesis or artificial replacement part The surgeon makes an incision around the part to be amputated The part is removed and the bone is smoothedA flap is constructed of muscle connective tissue andskin to cover the raw end of the bone The flap is closedover the bone with sutures surgical stitches that remainin place for about one month Often a rigid dressing or cast is applied that stays in place for about two weeks Preparation Before an amputation is performed extensive testing is done to determine the proper level of amputation Thegoal of the surgeon is to find the place where healing ismost likely to be complete while allowing the maximumamount of limb to remain for effective rehabilitation The greater the blood flow through an area the more likely healing is to occur These tests are designed to measure blood flow through the limb Several or all of themcan be done to help choose the proper level of amputation

general health of theamputee but ranges from several days to two weeks Rehabilitation is a long arduous process especially for above the knee amputees Twice daily physical therapy is not uncommon In addition psychological counseling is an important part of rehabilitation Many peoplefeel a sense of loss and grief when they lose a body partOthers are bothered by phantom limb syndrome wherethey feel

and used by the body to trigger specificchemical reactions The primary function of the enzymeamylase is to break down starches in food so that theycan be used by the body Amylase testing is usually doneto determine the cause of sudden abdominal pain Purpose Amylase testing is performed to diagnose a number of diseases that elevate amylase levels Pancreatitis for example is the most common reason for a high amylaselevel When the pancreas is inflamed amylase escapesfrom the pancreas into the blood Within six to hoursafter the pain begins amylase levels in the blood start torise Levels will stay high for several days before gradually returning to normal There are other causes of increased amylase An ulcer that erodes tissue from the stomach and goes intothe pancreas will cause amylase to spill into the bloodDuring a mumps infection amylase from the inflamed salivary glands increases Amylase is also found in theliver fallopian tubes and small intestine inflammation ofthese tissues also increases levels Gall bladder diseasetumors of the lung or ovaries alcohol poisoning ruptured aortic aneurysm and intestinal strangulation or perfora tion can also cause unusually high amylase levels Precautions This is not a screening test for future pancreatic dis ease Description Amylase testing is done on both blood and urine The laboratory may use any of several testing methodsthat involve mixing the blood or urine sample with a substance with which amylase is known to react By measuring the endproduct or the reaction time technicians cancalculate the amount of amylase present in the sampleMore sophisticated methods separately measure the amylase made by the pancreas and the amylase made by thesalivary glands Urine testing is a better longterm monitor of amy lase levels The kidneys quickly move extra amylasefrom the blood into the urine Urine levels rise six to hours after blood levels and stay high longer Urine isusually collected throughout a or hour time periodResults are usually available the same day Preparation In most cases no special preparation is necessary for a person undergoing an amylase blood test Patients takinglonger term urine amylase tests will be

affects thenerves responsible for movement It is also known asmotor neuron disease and Lou Gehrigs disease after thebaseball player whose career it ended Description ALS is a disease of the motor neurons those nerve cells reaching from the brain to the spinal cord uppermotor neurons and the spinal cord to the peripheralnerves lower motor neurons that control muscle movement In ALS for unknown reasons these neurons dieleading to a progressive loss of the ability to move virtually any of the muscles in the body ALS affects voluntary muscles those controlled by conscious thoughtsuch as the arm leg and trunk muscles ALS in and ofitself does not affect sensation thought processes theheart muscle or the smooth muscle of the digestive system bladder and other internal organs Most people withALS retain function of their eye muscles as well However various forms of ALS may be associated with a loss ofintellectual function dementia or sensory symptoms Amyotrophic refers to the loss of muscle bulk a cardinal sign of ALS Lateral indicates one of theregions of the spinal cord affected and sclerosisdescribes the hardened tissue that develops in place ofhealthy nerves ALS affects approximately peoplein the United States with about new cases eachyear It usually begins between the ages of and although younger onset is possible Men are slightlymore likely to develop ALS than women ALS progresses rapidly in most cases It is fatal within three years for of all people affected andwithin five years for Ten percent of people withALS live beyond eight years Causes and symptoms Causes The symptoms of ALS are caused by the death of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain Normally theseneurons convey electrical messages from the brain to themuscles to stimulate movement in the arms legs trunkneck and head As motor neurons die the muscles theyenervate cannot be moved as effectively and weaknessresults In addition lack of stimulation leads to musclewasting or loss of bulk Involvement of the upper motorneurons causes spasms and increased tone in the limbs andabnormal reflexes Involvement of the lower motor neuronscauses muscle wasting and twitching fasciculations Although many causes of motor neuron degenera tion have been suggested for ALS none has yet beenproven responsible Results of recent research haveimplicated toxic molecular fragments known as free radicals Some evidence suggests that a cascade of eventsleads to excess free radical production inside motor neurons leading to their death Why free radicals should beproduced in excess amounts is unclear as is whether thisexcess is the cause or the effect of other degenerativeprocesses Additional agents within this toxic cascademay include excessive levels of a neurotransmitterknown as glutamate which may overstimulate motorneurons thereby increasing freeradical production anda faulty detoxification enzyme known as SOD for GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Amyotrophic lateral sclerosisGEM to A PM Page superoxide dismutase type The actual pathway of destruction is not known however nor is the trigger forthe rapid degeneration that marks ALS Further researchmay show that other pathways are involved perhaps oneseven more important than this one Autoimmune factorsor premature aging may play some role as could viral agents or environmental toxins Two major forms of ALS are known familial and sporadic Familial ALS accounts for about of all ALScases As the name suggests familial ALS is believed to becaused by the inheritance of one or more faulty genesAbout of families with this type of ALS have mutations in the gene for SOD SOD gene defects are dominant meaning only one gene copy is needed to developthe disease Therefore a parent with the faulty gene has a chance of passing the gene along to a childSporadic ALS has no known cause While many environmental toxins have been suggested as causes todate no research has confirmed any of the candidatesinvestigated including aluminum and mercury and leadfrom dental fillings As research progresses it is likelythat many cases of sporadic ALS will be shown to have agenetic basis as well A third type called Western Pacific ALS occurs in Guam and other Pacific islands This form combinessymptoms of both ALS and Parkinsons disease Symptoms The earliest sign of ALS is most often weakness in

sporadic ALS Leg weaknessmay first become apparent by an increased frequency ofstumbling on uneven pavement or an unexplained difficulty climbing stairs Arm weakness may lead to difficulty grasping

swallowing and speaking Aperson with bulbar weakness may become hoarse or tiredafter speaking at length or speech may become slurred In addition to weakness the other cardinal signs of ALS are muscle wasting and persistent twitching fasciculation These are usually seen after weakness becomesobvious Fasciculation is quite common in people withoutthe disease and is virtually never the first sign of ALS While initial weakness may be limited to one region ALS almost always progresses rapidly to involve virtuallyall the voluntary muscle groups in the body Later symptoms include loss of the ability to walk to use the arms andhands to speak clearly or at all to swallow and to hold thehead up Weakness of the respiratory muscles makesbreathing and coughing difficult and poor swallowing control

extraocular muscles that move their eyes allowingsome communication to take place with simple blinks orthrough use of a computerassisted device Diagnosis The diagnosis of ALS begins with a complete med ical history and physical exam plus a neurological examination to determine the distribution and extent of weakness An electrical test of muscle function called an electromyogram or EMG is an important part of the diagnostic process Various other tests including blood andurine tests x rays and CT scans may be done to rule outother possible causes of the symptoms such as tumors ofthe skull

PM Page Nutritional advice can be provided by a nutritionist A person with ALS often needs softer foods to preventjaw exhaustion or choking Later in the disease nutri tion may be provided by a gastrostomy tube inserted into the stomach Mechanical ventilation may be used when breathing becomes too difficult Modern mechanical ventilators aresmall and portable allowing a person with ALS to maintain the maximum level of function and mobility Ventilation may be administered through a mouth or nose pieceor through a tracheostomy tube This tube is insertedthrough a small hole made in the windpipe In addition toproviding direct access to the airway the tube alsodecreases the risk aspiration While many people withrapidly progressing ALS choose not to use ventilators forlengthy periods they are increasingly being used to prolong life for a short time The progressive nature of ALS means that most per sons will eventually require fulltime nursing care Thiscare is often provided by a spouse or other family member While the skills involved are not difficult to learnthe physical and emotional burden of care can be overwhelming Caregivers need to recognize and provide fortheir own needs as well as those of people with ALS toprevent depression burnout and bitterness Throughout the disease a support group can provide important psychological aid to affected persons and theircaregivers as they come to terms with the losses ALSinflicts Support groups are sponsored by both the ALSSociety and the Muscular Dystrophy Association Alternative treatment Given the grave prognosis and absence of tradition al medical treatments it is not surprising that a largenumber of alternative treatments have been tried forALS Two studies published in suggested thataminoacid therapies may provide some improvementfor some people with ALS While individual reportsclaim benefits for megavitamin therapy herbal medicine and removal of dental fillings for instance no evidence suggests that these offer any more than a briefpsychological boost often followed by a more severeletdown when it becomes apparent the disease has continued unabated However once the causes of ALS arebetter understood alternative therapies may be moreintensively studied For example if damage by free radicals turns out to be the root of most of the symptomsantioxidant vitamins and supplements may be used more routinely to slow the progression of ALS Or ifenvironmental toxins are implicated alternative therapies with the goal of detoxifying the body may be ofsome usePrognosis ALS usually

an infection caused by bacteria called anaerobes which cannot grow in thepresence of oxygen Anaerobic bacteria can infect deepwounds deep tissues and internal organs where there is little oxygen These infections are characterized byabscess formation foulsmelling pus and tissue destruction Description Anaerobic means life without air Anaerobic bac teria grow in places which completely or almost completely lack oxygen They are normally found in themouth gastrointestinal tract and vagina and on the skinCommonly known diseases caused by anaerobic bacteriainclude gas gangrene tetanus and botulism Nearly all dental infections are caused by anaerobic bacteriaAnaerobic bacteria can cause an infection when a normal barrier such as skin gums or intestinal wallis damaged due to surgery injury or disease Usuallythe immune system kills any invading bacteria butsometimes the bacteria are able to grow and cause aninfection Body sites that have tissue destructionnecrosis or a poor blood supply are low in oxygenand favor the growth of anaerobic bacteria The lowoxygen condition can result from blood vessel diseaseshock injury and surgery Anaerobic bacteria can cause infection practically anywhere in the body For example Mouth head and neck Infections can occur in the root canals gums gingivitis jaw tonsils throat sinusesand ears Lung Anaerobic bacteria can cause pneumonia lung abscesses infecton of the lining of the lung empye ma and dilated lung bronchi bronchiectasis Intraabdominal Anaerobic infections within the abdomen include abscess formation peritonitis and appendicitis Female genital tract Anaerobic bacteria can cause pelvic abscesses pelvic inflammatory disease inflammation of the uterine lining endometritis andpelvic infections following abortion

bacteremia Causes and symptoms People who have experienced shock injury or surgery and those with blood vessel disease or tumorsare at an increased risk for infection by anaerobic bacteria There are many different kinds of anaerobic bacteriawhich can cause an infection Indeed most anaerobicinfections are mixed infections which means thatthere is a mixture of different bacteria growing

sore ulcer which drainsfoulsmelling pus Severe skin infections may causeextensive tissue destruction necrosis Bloodstream Bloodstream invasion causes high fever up to F C chills a general ill feeling andis potentially fatal Diagnosis The diagnosis of anaerobic infection is based pri marily on symptoms the patients medical history andlocation of the infection A foulsmelling infection ordrainage from an abscess is diagnostic of anaerobicinfection This foul smell is produced by anaerobic bacteria and occurs in one third to one half of patients late inthe infection Other clues to anaerobic infection includetissue necrosis and gas production at the infection site Asample from the infected site may be obtained using aswab or a needle and syringe to determine which bacteria is are causing the infection Because these bacteriacan be easily killed by oxygen they rarely grow in thelaboratory cultures of tissue or pus samplesKEY TERMS Abscess A lump filled with pus resulting from an infection Anaerobic Living and growing in the absence of oxygen Necrosis Tissue death and destruction resulting from infection or diseaseThe recent medical history of the patient is helpful in diagnosing anaerobic infection A patient who has orrecently had surgery dental work tumors blood vesseldisease or injury are susceptible to this infection Thefailure to improve following treatment with antibiotics that arent able to kill anaerobes is another clue that theinfection is caused by anaerobes The location and typeof infection also help in the diagnosis Diagnostic tests may include blood tests to see if bacteria are in the bloodstream and x rays to look atinternal infections Treatment Serious infections may require hospitalization for treatment Immediate antibiotic treatment of anaerobicinfections is necessary Laboratory testing may identifythe bacteria causing the infection and also which antibiotic will work best Every antibiotic does not workagainst all anaerobic bacteria but nearly all anaerobes arekilled by chloramphenicol Chloromycetin metronidazole Flagyl or Protostat and imipenem PrimaxinOther antibiotics which may be used are clindamycinCleocin or cefoxitin Mefoxin Surgical removal or drainage of the abscess is almost always required This may involve drainage byneedle and syringe to remove the pus from a skin abscesscalled aspiration The area would be numbed prior tothe aspiration procedure Also some internal abscessescan be drained using this procedure with the help ofultrasound a device which uses sound waves to visualizeinternal organs This type of abscess drainage may beperformed in the doctors office Prognosis Complete recovery should be achieved with the appropriate surgery and antibiotic treatment Untreatedor uncontrolled infections can cause severe tissue andbone destruction which would require plastic surgery torepair Serious infections can be life threatening Prevention Although anaerobic infections can occur in anyone good

kinds of anal atresia In boys with high anal atresia there may be a channel fistulaconnecting the large intestine to either the urethra whichdelivers urine from the bladder or the bladder itself Ingirls the channel may connect with the vagina Sixtypercent of children with high anal atresia have otherdefects including problems with the esophagus urinarytract and bones In low anal atresia the channel mayopen in front of the circular mass of muscles that constrict to close the anal opening anal sphincter or inboys below the scrotum Occasionally the intestine endsjust under the skin It is estimated that overall abnormalities of the anus and rectum occur in about one in every births and are slightly more common among boysA mother who has one child with these kind of conditions has a chance of having another child who suffers from this ailment Cause and symptoms Anal atresia is a defect in the development of the fetus The cause is unknown but genetics seem to play aminor role Diagnosis Usually a physician can make an obvious visual diagnosis of anal atesia right after birth Occasionallyhowever anal atresia is missed until the baby is fed andsigns of intestinal obstruction appear At the end of thefirst or second day the abdomen swells and there is vomiting of fecal material To determine the type of anal atresia and the exact position x rays will be taken whichinclude injecting opaque dye into the opening Magnetic resonance imaging MRI or computed tomography scans CT as well as ultrasound are the imaging tech niques used to determine the type and size of the analatresia Ultrasound uses sound waves CT scans pass xrays through the body at different angles and an MRIuses a magnetic field and radio wavesKEY TERMS Anus The canal at the end of the large intestine through which waste is excreted to the outside ofthe body Bowel obstruction Anything that prevents waste from moving normally to the anal opening Colostomy An operation where the large intes tine is diverted through an opening in theabdomen and waste is excreted Feces Bodily waste material that normally passes through the anus Fistula An abnormal channel that connects two organs or connects an organ to the skin Treatment Surgery is the only treatment for anal atresia For high anal atresia immediately after the diagnosis is madea surgical incision is made in the large intestine to make atemporary opening colostomy in the abdomen where waste is excreted Several months later the intestine ismoved into the ring of muscle sphincter that is part ofthe anus and a hole is made in the skin The colostomy isclosed several weeks later In low anal atresia immediately after diagnosis a hole is made in the skin to open thearea where the anus should be If the channel is in thewrong place the intestine is moved into the correct position sometime during the childs first year After surgerythe pediatric surgeon uses an instrument to dilate orwiden the rectum and teaches the parents how to do thisdaily at home to prevent scar tissue from contracting Prognosis With high anal atresia many children have problems controlling bowel function Most also become constipated With low anal

part of which is inside the body and part ofwhich is outside Sometimes abnormal changes of theanus are harmless in their early stages but may laterdevelop into cancer Some anal warts for example con tain precancerous areas and can develop into cancerTypes of anal cancer include Squamous Cell Carcinomas Approximately half of anal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas which arisefrom the cells lining the anal margin and the anal canalThe anal margin is the part of the anus that is half insideand half outside the body and the anal canal is the partof the anus that is inside the body The earliest form ofsquamous cell carcinoma is known as carcinoma insitu or Bowens disease Cloacogenic Carcinomas Approximately onefourth to onethird of anal tumors are cloacogenic carcinomasThese tumors develop in the transitional zone or cloaca which is a ring of tissue between the anal canal andthe rectum Adenocarcinomas About of anal cancers are ade nocarcinomas which affect glands in the anal

of who have no symptomsshould have a digital rectal examination DRE every fiveto years according to American Cancer Society ACSguidelines for early detection of colorectal cancer Other diagnostic procedures for anal cancer include Anoscopy A procedure that involves use of a special device to examine the anus Proctoscopy A procedure thatinvolves use of a lighted scope to see the anal canal Transrectal ultrasound A procedure in which sound waves areused to create an image of the anus and nearby tissues A biopsy is performed on any suspicious growths that is a tiny piece of the growth is examined under amicroscope for cancer cells The physician may also perform a procedure called a fine needle aspiration biopsyin which a needle is used to withdraw fluid from lymphnodes located near the growth to make sure the cancerhasnt spread to these nodes Anal cancer severity is categorized by the following stages Stage anal cancer is found only in the top layer of anal tissue Stage I anal

lymph nodes within the abdomen or to distant organs Treatment Anal cancer is treated using three methods used either in concert or individually surgery radiation ther apy and chemotherapy Two types of surgery may be performed A local resection performed if the cancer has not spreadremoves the tumor and an area of tissue around the tumorAn abdominoperineal resection is a more complex procedure in which the anus and the lower rectum are removedand an opening called a colostomy is created for body wastes to exit This procedure is fairly uncommon todaybecause radiation and chemotherapy are just as effective Radiation therapy uses highenergy rays to fight cancer cells It is usually delivered via a machine outsidethe body but may also be delivered via surgicallyimplanted radioactive pellets This latter method is calledinternal radiation brachytherapy or interstitial radiationSide effects of radiation may include tiredness skin damage resembling sunburn and damage to anal tissues Chemotherapy fights cancer using drugs which may be delivered via pill or needle Some chemotherapy typeskill cancer cells directly while others act indirectly bymaking cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation Themain drugs used to treat anal cancer are fluorouracil FU and mitomycin or FU and cisplatin Side effects ofchemotherapy which damages normal cells in addition tocancer cells may include nausea and vomiting hair loss loss of appetite diarrhea mouth sores fatigue shortness of breath and a weakened immune system Alternative treatment Research suggests acupuncture can help manage

blemishes that can be as small as the head of a pin or grow into larger cauliflowerlike protuberances They can be yellow pink or lightbrown in color and only rarely are painful or uncomfortable In fact infected individuals often are unaware thatthey exist Most cases are caused by sexual transmission Most individuals have between one to genital warts thtat range in size from roughly cm Some will complain of painless bumps or itching but often these warts can remain completely unnoticed Causes and symptoms Condyloma acuminatum is one of the most common sexually transmitted disease STD in the United StatesYoung adults aged to years are at greatest riskRisk factors include smoking using oral contracep tives having multiple sexual partners and an early coital age In addition individuals who have a history ofimmunosuppression or anal intercourse are also at risk Roughly of all anal warts are caused by the human papilloma virus HPV types and which arethe least likely of over types of HPV to become cancerous Anal warts are usually transmitted through directsexual contact with someone who is infected with condyloma acuminata anywhere in the genital area includingthe penis and vagina Studies have shown that roughly of those who engage in sexual contact with someone infected with condyloma acuminata will developthese warts within three months Treatment According to guidelines from the Centers for Dis ease Control CDC the treatment of all genital wartsincluding anal warts should be conducted according tothe methods preferred by the patient the medications orprocedures most readily available and the experience ofthe patients physician in removing anal warts Treatment options include electrical cautery surgi cal removal or both Warts that appear inside the analcanal will almost always be treated with cauterization orsurgical removal Surgical removal also known as excision has the highest success rates and lowest recurrencerates Indeed studies have shown that initial cure ratesrange from Unfortunately most cases require numerous treat ments because the virus that causes the warts can live inthe surrounding tissue The area may seem normal andwartfree for six months or longer before another wartdevelops Laser surgery is another possibility but requires local general or spinal anesthesia depending on thenumber warts and where they are Electrocoagulation a technique that uses electrical energy to destroy the warts is usually the most painful ofthe procedures done to eliminate condyloma acuminataof the anus and is usually reserved for larger warts It isdone with local anesthesia and may cause discharge orbleeding from the anus Followup visits to the physician are necessary to make sure that the warts have not recurred It is recommended that these patients see their physicians everythree to six months for up to years which is how longthe incubation period is for the HPV virus Carbon dioxide laser treatment and electrodesicca tion are other options but these are usually reserved forextensive warts or those that continue to recur despitenumerous treatments However because HPV virus canbe transmitted via the smoke caused by these proceduresthey are usually reserved for the worst infections For small warts that affect only the skin around the anus several medications are available which can beapplied directly to the surface of the warts by a physicianor by the patients themselves Such medications include podophyllum resin Podocon PodBen a substance made from thecytotoxic extracts of several plants This agent offers a GALE

Trichloroacetic and bichloroacetic acids are avail able in several concentrations up to for the treatment of condyloma acuminata These acids work to cauterize the skin and are quite caustic Nevertheless theycause less irritation and overall body effects than theother agents mentioned above Recurrence however ishigher with these acids Bleomycin Blenoxane is another treatment option but it has several drawbacks First it must be administered by a physician into each lesion via injection but iscan have a host of side effects and patients must be followed carefully by their physician Imiquimod cream is also available for patients to apply themselves It is to be applied three times weeklyfor up to weeks and has been shown to clear wartswithin eight to weeks Finally the interferon

a week for up to eight weeks Prognosis Once a diagnosis of anal warts has been made fur ther outbreaks can be controlled or sometimes preventedwith proper care Unfortunately many cases of anal wartseither fail to respond to treatment or recur Patients haveto undergo roughly six to nine treatments over severalmonths to assure that the warts are completely eradicated Recurrence rates have been estimated to be over after one year and may be due to the long incubation ofHPV up to years deep lesions undetected lesionsvirus present in surrounding skin that is not treated Prevention Sexual abstinence and monogamous relationships can be the most effective form of prevention and condomsmay also decrease the chances of transmission of condyloma acuminata Abstinence from sexual relations

is pain relief The primary classes of analgesics are thenarcotics including additional agents that are chemically GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AnalgesicsGEM to A PM Page based on the morphine molecule but have minimal abuse potential nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs including the salicylates andacetaminophen Other drugs notably the tricyclic anti depressants and antiepileptic agents such as gabapentinhave been used to relieve pain particularly neurologicpain but are not routinely classified as analgesics Analgesics provide symptomatic relief but have no effect oncausation although clearly the NSAIDs by virtue oftheir dual activity may be beneficial in both regards Description Pain has been classified as productive pain and nonproductive pain While this distinction has nophysiologic meaning it may serve as a guide to treatment Productive pain has been described as a warningof injury and so may be both an indication of need fortreatment and a guide to diagnosis Nonproductivepain by definition serves no purpose either as a warningor diagnostic tool Although pain syndromes may be dissimilar the common factor is a sensory pathway from the affectedorgan to the brain Analgesics work at the level of thenerves either by blocking the signal from the peripheralnervous system or by distorting the interpretation by thecentral nervous system Selection of an appropriate analgesic is based on consideration of the riskbenefit factorsof each class of drugs based on type of pain severity ofpain and risk of adverse effects Traditionally pain hasbeen divided into two classes acute and chronicalthough severity and projected patient survival are otherfactors that must be considered in drug selection Acute pain Acute pain is self limiting in duration and includes postoperative pain pain of injury and childbirth Because pain of these types is expected to be short termthe longterm side effects of analgesic therapy may routinely be ignored Thus these patients may safely betreated with narcotic analgesics without concern for theiraddictive potential or NSAIDs with only limited concernfor their ulcerogenic risks Drugs and doses should beadjusted based on observation of healing rate switchingpatients from high to low doses and from narcotic analgesics to nonnarcotics when circumstances permit An important consideration of pain management in severe pain is that patients should not be subject to thereturn of pain Analgesics should be dosed adequately toassure that the pain is at least tolerable and frequentlyenough to avoid the anxiety that accompanies the antici pated return of pain Analgesics should never be dosed ona prn as needed basis but should be administered oftenenough to assure constant blood levels of analgesic This applies to both the narcotic and nonnarcotic analgesics Chronic pain Chronic pain pain lasting over three months and severe enough to impair function is more difficult totreat since the anticipated side effects of the analgesicsare more difficult to manage In the case of narcotic analgesics this means the addiction potential as well as res piratory depression and constipation For the NSAIDs the risk of gastric ulcers may be dose limiting Whilesome classes of drugs such as the narcotic agonistantagonist drugs bupronophine nalbuphine and pentazocineand the selective COX inhibitors celecoxib and rofecoxib represent advances in reduction of adverse effectsthey are still not fully suitable for longterm managementof severe pain Generally chronic pain managementrequires a combination of drug therapy lifestyle modification and other treatment modalities Narcotic analgesics The narcotic analgesics also termed opioids are all derived from opium The class includes morphinecodeine and a number of semisynthetics includingmeperidine Demerol propoxyphen Darvon and others The narcotic analgesics vary in potency but all areeffective in treatment of visceral pain when used in adequate doses Adverse effects are dose related Becausethese drugs are all addictive they are controlled underfederal and state laws A variety of dosage forms areavailable including oral solids liquids intravenous andintrathecal injections and transcutaneous patches NSAIDs nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are effective analgesics even at doses too low to have anyantiinflammatory effects There are a number of chemical classes but all have similar therapeutic effects andside effects Most are appropriate only for oral administration however ketorolac Toradol is appropriate forinjection and may be used in moderate to severe pain forshort periods Acetaminophen is a nonnarcotic analgesic with no antiinflammatory properties It is appropriate for mild tomoderate pain Although the drug is well tolerated in normal doses it may have significant toxicity at high dosesBecause acetaminophen is largely free of side effects attherapeutic doses it has been considered the first choicefor mild pain including that

with patient age and condition For example narcotic analgesics should usually be avoided in patients with ahistory of substance abuse but may be fully appropriatein patients with cancer pain Similarly because narcotics are more rapidly metabolized in patients who have usedthese drugs for a long period higher than normal dosesmay be needed to provide adequate pain managementNSAIDs although comparatively safe in adults represent an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding inpatients over the age of Precautions Narcotic analgesics may be contraindicated in patients with respiratory depression NSAIDS may behazardous to patients with ulcers or an ulcer historyThey should be used with care in patients with renalinsufficiency or coagulation disorders NSAIDs are contraindicated in patients allergic to aspirin Side effects Review adverse effects of each drug individually Drugs within a class may vary in their frequency andseverity of adverse effects The primary adverse effects of the narcotic anal gesics are addiction constipation and respiratorydepression Because narcotic analgesics stimulate theproduction of enzymes that cause the metabolism ofthese drugs patients on narcotics for a prolonged periodmay require increasing doses This is not the same thingas addiction and is not a reason for withholding medication from patients in severe pain NSAIDs are ulcerogenic

Uretsky PharmD Analgesics opioid Definition Opioid analgesics also known as narcotic anal gesics are pain relievers that act on the central nervous system Like all narcotics they may become habitforming if used over long periods Purpose Opioid analgesics are used to relieve pain from a variety of conditions Some are used before or duringsurgery including dental surgery both to relieve pain andto make anesthetics work more effectively They may alsobe used for the same purposes during labor and delivery Description Opioid analgesics relieve pain by acting directly on the central nervous system However this can also leadto unwanted side effects such as drowsiness dizziness breathing problems and physical or mental dependence Among the drugs in this category are codeine pro

Definition Anaphylaxis is a rapidly progressing lifethreaten ing allergic reaction GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AnaphylaxisGEM to A PM Page Description Anaphylaxis is a type of allergic reaction in which the immune system responds to otherwise harmless substances from the environment Unlike other allergicreactions however anaphylaxis can kill Reaction maybegin within minutes or even seconds of exposure andrapidly progress to cause airway constriction skin andintestinal irritation and altered heart rhythms In severecases it can result in complete airway obstructionshock and death Causes and symptoms Causes Like the majority of other allergic reactions anaphy laxis is caused by the release of histamine and otherchemicals from mast cells Mast cells are a type of whiteblood cell and they are found in large numbers in the tissues that regulate exchange with the environment theairways digestive system and skin On their surfaces mast cells display antibodies called IgE immunoglobulin type E These antibodiesare designed to detect environmental substances towhich the immune system is sensitive Substances froma genuinely threatening source such as bacteria orviruses are called antigens A substance that most people tolerate well but to which others have an allergicresponse is called an allergen When IgE antibodiesbind with allergens they cause the mast cell to releasehistamine and other chemicals which spill out ontoneighboring cells The interaction of these chemicals with receptors on the surface of blood vessels causes the vessels to leakfluid into surrounding tissues causing fluid accumulation redness and swelling On the smooth muscle cellsof the airways and digestive system they cause constriction On nerve endings they increase sensitivity andcause itching In anaphylaxis the dramatic response is due both to extreme hypersensivity to the allergen and its usuallysystemic distribution Allergens are more likely to causeanaphylaxis if they are introduced directly into the circulatory system by injection However exposure by ingestion inhalation or skin contact can also cause anaphylaxis In some cases anaphylaxis may develop over timefrom less severe allergies Anaphylaxis is most often due to allergens in foods drugs and insect venom Specific causes include fish shellfish and mollusks nuts and seeds stings of bees wasps or hornets papain from meat tenderizers vaccines including flu and measles vaccines penicillin cephalosporins streptomycin gamma globulin insulin hormones ACTH thyroidstimulating hormoneaspirin and other NSAIDs latex from exam gloves or condoms for example Exposure to cold or exercise can trigger anaphylaxis in some individuals Symptoms Symptoms may include urticaria hives swelling and irritation of the tongue or mouth swelling of the sinuses difficulty breathing wheezing cramping vomiting or diarrhea anxiety or confusion strong very rapid heartbeat palpitations loss of consciousness Not all symptoms may be present Diagnosis Anaphylaxis is diagnosed based on the rapid devel opment of symptoms in response to a suspect allergenIdentification of the culprit may be done with RAST testing a blood test that identifies IgE reactions to specificallergens Skin testing may be done for less severe anaphylactic reactions Treatment Emergency treatment of anaphylaxis involves injec tion of adrenaline epinephrine which constricts bloodvessels and counteracts the effects of histamine Oxygenmay be given as well as intravenous replacement fluidsAntihistamines may be used for skin rash and amino phylline for bronchial constriction If the upper airway isobstructed placement of a breathing tube or tracheostomy tube may be needed GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AnaphylaxisGEM to A PM Page Prognosis The rapidity of symptom development is an indica tion of the likely severity of reaction the faster symptoms develop the more severe the ultimate reactionPrompt emergency medical attention and close monitoring reduces the likelihood of death Nonetheless death ispossible from severe anaphylaxis For most people whoreceive rapid treatment recovery is complete Prevention Avoidance of the allergic trigger is the only reliable method of preventing anaphylaxis For insect allergiesthis requires recognizing likely nest sites Preventing foodallergies requires knowledge of the prepared foods ordishes in which the allergen is likely to occur and carefulquestioning about ingredients when dining out Use of aMedicAlert tag detailing drug allergies is vital to preventinadvertent administration

levels of healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin thecomponent of red blood cells that delivers oxygen to tissues throughout the body Description The tissues of the human body need a regular supply of oxygen to stay healthy Red blood cells which containhemoglobin that allows them to deliver oxygen throughoutthe body live for only about days When they die theiron they contain is returned to the bone marrow and usedto create new red blood cells Anemia develops whenheavy bleeding causes significant iron loss or when something happens to slow down the production of red bloodcells or to increase the rate at which they are destroyed Types of anemia Anemia can be mild moderate or severe enough to lead to lifethreatening complications More than different types of anemia have been identified Many ofthem are rare IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA Iron deficiency ane miais the most common form of anemia in the world In the United States iron deficiency anemia affects about toddlers between one and two years of age and million women of childbearing age This condition isless common in older children and in adults over andrarely occurs in teenage boys and young men The onset of iron deficiency anemia is gradual and at first there may not be any symptoms The deficiencybegins when the body loses more iron than it derivesfrom food and other sources Because depleted ironstores cannot meet the red blood cells needs fewer redblood cells develop In this early stage of anemia the redblood cells look normal but they are reduced in numberThen the body tries to compensate for the iron deficiencyby producing more red blood cells which are characteristically small in size Symptoms develop at this stage FOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY ANEMIA Folic acid defi ciency anemia is the most common type of megaloblas tic anemia in which red blood cells are bigger than normal It is caused by a deficiency of folic acid a vitamin that the body needs to produce normal cells Folic acid anemia is especially common in infants and teenagers Although this condition usually resultsfrom a dietary deficiency it is sometimes due to inabilityto absorb enough folic acid from such foods as GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AnemiasGEM to A PM Page cheese eggs fish green vegetables meat milk mushrooms yeast Smoking raises the risk of developing this condition by interfering with the absorption of Vitamin C which thebody needs to absorb folic acid Folic acid anemia can bea complication of pregnancy when a womans body needs eight times more folic acid than it does otherwise VITAMIN B DEFICIENCY ANEMIA Less common in this country than folic acid anemia vitamin Bdeficien cy anemia is another type of megaloblastic anemia thatdevelops when the body doesnt absorb enough of thisnutrient Necessary for the creation of red blood cells B is found in meat and vegetables Large amounts of Bare stored in the body so this condition may not become apparent until as much as fouryears after B absorption stops or slows down The resulting drop in red blood cell production can cause loss of muscle control loss of sensation in the legs hands and feet soreness or burning of the tongue weight loss yellowblue color blindness The most common form of Bdeficiency is perni cious anemia Since most people who eat meat or eggs get enough Bin their diets a deficiency of this vitamin usually means that the body is not absorbing it properlyThis can occur among people who have had intestinalsurgery or among those who do not produce adequateamounts of intrinsic factor a chemical secreted by thestomach lining that combines with B to help its absorp tion in the small intestine Pernicious anemia usually strikes between the ages of Eating disorders or an unbalanced diet increases the risk of developing pernicious anemia So do diabetes mellitusgastritis stomach cancer or stomach surgery thyroid disease family history of pernicious anemia VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY ANEMIA A rare disorder that causes the bone marrow to manufacture abnormallysmall red blood cells Vitamin C deficiency anemia results from a severe longstanding dietary deficiency HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA Some people are born with hemolytic anemia Some acquire this condition in which infection or antibodies destroy red blood cellsmore rapidly than bone marrow can replace them Hemolytic anemia can enlarge the spleen accelerat ing the destruction of red blood cells hemolysis Othercomplications of hemolytic anemia include pain shock gallstones and other serious health problems THALASSEMIAS An inherited form of hemolytic anemia thalassemia stems from the bodys inability to manufacture as much normal hemoglobin as it needsThere are two categories of thalassemia depending onwhich of the amino acid chains is affected Hemoglobinis composed of four chains of amino acids In alphathalassemia there is an imbalance in the production of thealpha chain of amino acids in betathalassemia there isan imbalance in the beta chain Alphathalassemias mostcommonly affect blacks have at least one genebetathalassemias most commonly affect people ofMediterranean ancestry and Southeast Asians Characterized by production of red blood cells that are unusually small and fragile thalassemia only affectspeople who inherit the gene for it from each parent autosomal recessive inheritance AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS Warm anti body hemolytic anemia is the most common type of thisdisorder This condition occurs when the body producesautoantibodies that coat red blood cells The coated cellsare destroyed by the spleen liver or bone marrow Warm antibody hemolytic anemia is more common in women than in men About onethird of patients whohave warm antibody hemolytic anemia also have lymphoma leukemia lupus or connective tissue disease In cold antibody hemolytic anemia the body attacks red blood cells at or below normal body temperature Theacute form of this condition frequently develops in people who have had pneumonia mononeucleosis or other acute infections It tends to be mild and shortlived anddisappears without treatment Chronic cold antibody hemolytic anemia is most common in women and most often affects those who areover and who have arthritis This condition usuallylasts for a lifetime generally causing few symptomsHowever exposure to cold temperatures can accelerate GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AnemiasGEM to A PM Page red blood cell destruction causing fatigue joint aches and discoloration of the arms and hands SICKLE CELL ANEMIA Sickle cell anemia is a chron ic incurable condition that causes the body to producedefective hemoglobin which forces red blood cells toassume an abnormal crescent shape Unlike normal ovalcells fragile sickle cells cant hold enough hemoglobinto nourish body tissues The deformed shape makes ithard for sickle cells to pass through narrow blood vessels When capillaries become obstructed a lifethreatening condition called sickle cell crisis is likely to occur Sickle cell anemia is hereditary It almost always affects blacks and people of Mediterranean descent Achild who inherits the sickle cell gene from each parentwill have the disease A child who inherits the sickle cellgene from only one parent carries the sickle cell trait butdoes not have the disease APLASTIC ANEMIA Sometimes curable by bone marrow transplant but potentially fatal aplastic anemia is characterized by decreased production of red andwhite blood cells and platelets discshaped cells thatallow the blood to clot This disorder may be inheritedor acquired as a result of recent severe illness longterm exposure to industrial chemicals use of anticancer drugs and certain other medications ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE Cancer chronic infection or inflammation and kidney and liver diseaseoften cause mild or moderate anemia Chronic liver failure generally produces the most severe symptoms Causes and symptoms Anemia is caused by bleeding decreased red blood cell production or increased red blood cell destructionPoor diet can contribute to vitamin deficiency and irondeficiency anemias in which fewer red blood cells areproduced Hereditary disorders and certain diseases cancause increased blood cell destruction However excessive bleeding is the most common cause of anemia andthe speed with which blood loss occurs has a significanteffect on the severity of symptoms Chronic blood loss isusually a consequence of cancer gastrointestinal tumors diverticulosis polyposis heavy menstrual flow hemorrhoids nosebleeds stomach ulcers longstanding alcohol abuse Acute blood loss is usually the result of childbirth injury a ruptured blood vessel surgery When a lot of blood is lost within a short time blood pressure and the amount of oxygen in the body drop suddenly Heart failure and death can follow Loss of even onethird of the bodys blood volume in the space of several hours can be fatal More gradual bloodloss is less serious because the body has time to createnew red blood cells to replace those that have been lost Symptoms Weakness fatigue and a rundown feeling may be signs of mild anemia Skin that is pasty or sallow or lackof color in the creases of the palm gums nail beds orlining of the eyelids are other signs of anemia Someonewho is weak tires easily is often out of breath and feelsfaint or dizzy may be severely anemic Other symptoms of anemia are angina pectoris chest pain often accompanied by a choking sensation that provokes severe anxiety cravings for ice paint or dirt headache inability to concentrate memory loss inflammation of the mouth stomatitis or tongue glossitis insomnia irregular heartbeat loss of appetite nails that are dry brittle or ridged rapid breathing sores in the mouth throat or rectum sweating swelling of the hands and feet thirst tinnitus

presence of certain types of anemia Laboratory tests thatmeasure the percentage of red blood cells or the amountof hemoglobin in the blood are used to confirm diagnosisand determine which type of anemia is responsible for apatients symptoms X rays and examinations of bonemarrow may be used to identify the source of bleeding Treatment Anemia due to nutritional deficiencies can usually be treated at home with iron supplements or self administered injections of vitamin B People with folic acid anemia should take oral folic acid replacements VitaminC deficiency anemia can be cured by taking one vitaminC tablet a day Surgery may be necessary to treat anemia caused by excessive loss of blood Transfusions of red blood cellsmay be used to accelerate production of red blood cells Medication or surgery may also be necessary to con trol heavy menstrual flow repair a bleeding ulcer orremove polyps growths or nodules from the bowels Patients with thalassemia usually do not require treatment However people with a severe form mayrequire periodic hospitalization for blood transfusionsandor bone marrow transplantation SICKLE CELL ANEMIA Treatment for sickle cell ane mia involves regular eye examinations immunizationsfor pneumonia and infectious diseases and prompt treatment for sickle cell crises and infections of any kindPsychotherapy or counseling may help patients deal withthe emotional impact of this condition VITAMIN BDEFICIENCY ANEMIA A lifelong regi men of Bshots is necessary to control symptoms of per nicious anemia The patient may be advised to limit physical activity until treatment restores strength and balanceAPLASTIC ANEMIA People who have aplastic ane mia are especially susceptible to infection Treatment foraplastic anemia may involve blood transfusions and bonemarrow transplant to replace malfunctioning cells withhealthy ones ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE There is no specific treatment for anemia associated with chronic disease buttreating

Anencephaly seeCongenital brain defects Anesthesia general Definition General anesthesia is the induction of a state of uncon sciousness with the absence of pain sensation over the entire body through the administration of anesthetic drugsIt is used during certain medical and surgical procedures Purpose General anesthesia has many purposes including pain relief analgesia blocking memory of the procedure amnesia producing unconsciousness inhibiting normal body reflexes to make surgery safe and easier to perform relaxing the muscles of the body Description Anesthesia performed with general anesthetics occurs in four stages which may or may not be observable because they can occur very rapidly GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Anesthesia generalGEM to A PM Page Stage One Analgesia The patient experiences analge sia or a loss of pain sensation but remains consciousand can carry on a conversation Stage Two Excitement The patient may experience delirium or become violent Blood pressure rises and becomes irregular and breathing rate increases Thisstage is typically bypassed by administering a barbiturate such as sodium pentothal before the anesthesia Stage Three Surgical Anesthesia During this stage the skeletal muscles relax and the patients breathingbecomes regular Eye movements slow then stop andsurgery can begin Stage Four Medullary Paralysis This stage occurs if the respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata of thebrain that control breathing and other vital functionscease to function Death can result if the patient cannot be revived quickly This stage should never be reachedCareful control of the amounts of anesthetics administered prevent this occurrence Agents used for general anesthesia may be either gases or volatile liquids that are vaporized and inhaledwith oxygen or drugs delivered intravenously A combination of inhaled anesthetic gases and intravenous drugsare usually delivered during general anesthesia thispractice is called balanced anesthesia and is used becauseit takes advantage of the beneficial effects of each anesthetic agent to reach surgical anesthesia If necessary theextent of the anesthesia produced by inhaling a generalanesthetic can be rapidly modified by adjusting the concentration of the anesthetic in the oxygen that is breathedby the patient The degree of anesthesia produced by anintravenously injected anesthesic is fixed and cannot bechanged as rapidly Most commonly intravenous anesthetic agents are used for induction of anesthesia andthen followed by inhaled anesthetic agents General anesthesia works by altering the flow of sodium molecules into nerve cells neurons through thecell membrane Exactly how the anesthetic does this isnot understood since the drug apparently does not bind toany receptor on the cell surface and does not seem toaffect the release of chemicals that transmit nerveimpulses neurotransmitters from the nerve cells It isknown however that when the sodium molecules do notget into the neurons nerve impulses are not generatedand the brain becomes unconscious does not store memories does not register pain impulses from other areas ofthe body and does not control involuntary reflexesAlthough anesthesia may feel like deep sleep it is not thesame In sleep some parts of the brain speed up whileothers slow down Under anesthesia the loss of consciousness is more widespreadWhen general anesthesia was first introduced in medical practice ether and chloroform were inhaled withthe physician manually covering the patients mouthSince then general anesthesia has become much moresophisticated During most surgical procedures anesthetic agents are now delivered and controlled by computerized equipment that includes anesthetic gas monitoringas well as patient monitoring equipment Anesthesiologists are the physicians that specialize in the delivery ofanesthetic agents Currently used inhaled general anesthetics include halothane enflurane isoflurane desfluorane sevofluorane and nitrous oxide Halothane Fluothane is a powerful anesthetic and can easily be overadministered This drug causes unconsciousness but little pain relief so it is often used withother agents to control pain Very rarely it can be toxicto the liver in adults causing death It also has thepotential for causing serious cardiac dysrhythmiasHalothane has a pleasant odor and was frequently theanesthetic of choice for use with children but since theintroduction of sevofluorane in the s halothaneuse has declined Enflurane Ethrane is less potent and results in a more rapid onset of anesthesia and faster awakeningthan halothane In addition it acts as an enhancer ofparalyzing agents Enflurane has been found toincrease intracranial pressure and the risk of seizurestherefore its use is contraindicated in patients withseizure disorders Isoflurane Forane is not toxic to the liver but can cause some cardiac irregularities Isofluorane is oftenused in combination with intravenous anesthetics foranesthesia induction Awakening from anesthesia isfaster than it is with halothane and enfluorane Desfluorane Suprane may increase the heart rate and should not be used in patients with aortic valve steno sis however it does not usually cause heart arrhyth mias Desflurane may cause coughing and excitation during induction and is therefore used with intravenousanesthetics for induction Desflurane is rapidly eliminated and awakening is therefore faster than with otherinhaled agents Sevofluorane Ultane may also cause increased heart rate and should not be used in patients with narrowedaortic valve stenosis however it does not usuallycause heart arrhythmias Unlike desfluorane sevofluorane does not cause any coughing or other related sideeffects and can therefore be used without intravenousagents for rapid induction For this reason sevofluoraneis replacing halothane for induction in pediatricpatients Like desfluorane this agent is rapidly eliminated and allows rapid awakening GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Anesthesia generalGEM to A PM Page Nitrous oxide laughing gas is a weak anesthetic and is used with other agents such as thiopental to producesurgical anesthesia It has the fastest induction andrecovery and is the safest because it does not slowbreathing or blood flow to the brain However it diffuses rapidly into aircontaining cavities and can result in acollapsed lung pneumothorax or lower the oxygen contents of tissues hypoxia Commonly administered intravenous anesthetic agents include ketamine thiopental opioids and propofol Ketamine Ketalar affects the senses and produces a dissociative anesthesia catatonia amnesia analgesia in which the patient may appear awake and reactive butcannot respond to sensory stimuli These propertiesmake it especially useful for use in developing countries and during warfare medical treatment Ketamine isfrequently used in pediatric patients because anesthesiaand analgesia can be achieved with an intramuscularinjection It is also used in highrisk geriatric patientsand in shock cases because it also provides cardiac stimulation Thiopental Pentothal is a barbiturate that induces a rapid hypnotic state of short duration Because thiopental is slowly metabolized by the liver toxic accumulation can occur therefore it should not be continuouslyinfused Side effects include nausea and vomiting upon awakening Opioids include fentanyl sufentanil and alfentanil and are frequently used prior to anesthesia and surgery as asedative and analgesic as well as a continuous infusionfor primary anesthesia Because opioids rarely affectthe cardiovascular system they are particularly usefulfor cardiac surgery and other highrisk cases Opioidsact directly on spinal cord receptors and are freqentlyused in epidurals for spinal anesthesia Side effects mayinclude nausea and vomiting itching and respiratory depression Propofol Diprivan is a nonbarbiturate hypnotic agent and the most recently developed intravenous anestheticIts rapid induction and short duration of action are identical to thiopental but recovery occurs more quicklyand with much less nausea and vomiting Also propofol is rapidly metabolized in the liver and excreted inthe urine so it can be used for long durations of anesthesia unlike thiopental Hence propofol is rapidlyreplacing thiopental as an intravenous induction agentIt is used for general surgery cardiac surgery neuro surgery and pediatric surgery General anesthetics are given only by anesthesiolo gists the medical professionals trained

medical procedure being done and other medicationthe patient takes before during or after surgery Precautions Although the risks of serious complications from general anesthesia are very low they can include heart attack stroke brain damage and death Anyone sched uled to undergo general anesthesia should thoroughlydiscuss the benefits and risks with a physician The risksof complications depend in part on a patients age sexweight allergies general health and history of smoking drinking alcohol or drug use Some of these risks can beminimized by ensuring that the physician and anesthesiologist are fully informed of the detailed health conditionof the patient including any drugs that he or she may beusing Older people are especially sensitive to the effectsof certain anesthetics and may be more likely to experience side effects from these drugs Patients who have had general anesthesia should not drink alcoholic beverages or take medication that slowdown the central nervous system such

application of an anesthetic drug to a specific area of thebody as opposed to the entire body and brain as occursduring general anesthesia GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Anesthesia localGEM to A PM Page Purpose Local anesthetics are used to prevent patients from feeling pain during medical surgical or dental proce dures Overthecounter local anesthetics are also available to provide temporary relief from pain irritation anditching caused by various conditions such as cold sores canker sores sore throats sunburn insect bites poison ivy and minor cuts and scratches Types of surgery or medical procedures that regular ly make use of local or regional anesthesia include thefollowing biopsies in which skin or tissue samples are taken for diagnostic procedures childbirth surgeries on the arms hands legs or feet eye surgery surgeries involving the urinary tract or sexual organs Surgeries involving the chest and abdomen are usu ally performed under general anesthesia Local and regional anesthesia have advantages over general anesthesia in that patients can avoid someunpleasant side effects can receive longer lasting painrelief have reduced blood loss and maintain a sense ofpsychological comfort by not losing consciousness Description Regional anesthesia typically affects a larger area than local anesthesia for example everything below the waistAs a result regional anesthesia may be used for moreinvolved or complicated surgical or medical proceduresRegional anesthetics are injected Local anesthesia involvesthe injection into the skin or muscle or application to theskin of an anesthetic directly where pain will occur Localanesthesia can be divided into four groups injectable topical dental noninjectable and ophthalmic Local and regional anesthesia work by altering the flow of sodium molecules into nerve cells or neuronsthrough the cell membrane Exactly how the anestheticdoes this is not understood since the drug apparentlydoes not bind to any receptor on the cell surface and doesnot seem to affect the release of chemicals that transmitnerve impulses neurotransmitters from the nerve cellsIt is known however that when the sodium molecules donot get into the neurons nerve impulses are not generated and pain impulses are not transmitted to the brain Theduration of action of an anesthetic depends on the typeand amount of anesthetic administered Regional anesthesia Types of regional anesthesia include Spinal anesthesia Spinal anesthesia involves the injec tion of a small amount of local anesthetic directly intothe cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the spinal cord thesubarachnoid space Blood pressure drops are common but are easily treated Epidural anesthesia Epidural anesthesia involves the injection of a large volume of local anesthetic directlyinto the space surrounding the spinal fluid sac theepidural space not into the spinal fluid Pain reliefoccurs more slowly but is less likely to produce bloodpressure drops Also the block can be maintained forlong periods even days Nerve blocks Nerve blocks involve the injection of an anesthetic into the area around a nerve that supplies aparticular region of the body preventing the nerve fromcarrying nerve impulses to the brain Anesthetics may be administered with another drug such as epinephrine adrenaline which decreases bleeding and sodium bicarbonate to decrease the acidity of adrug so that it will work faster In addition drugs may beadministered to help a patient remain calm and morecomfortable or to make them sleepy Local anesthesia INJECTABLE LOCAL ANESTHETICS

the type of local anesthetic and the purpose for which it is beingused When using a nonprescription local anesthetic follow the directions on the package Questions concerninghow to use a product should be referred to a medical doctor dentist or pharmacist Precautions People who strongly feel that they cannot psycho logically cope with being awake and alert during certainprocedures may not be good candidates for local orregional anesthesia Other medications may be given inconjunction with the anesthetic however to relieve anxi etyand help the patient relax Local anesthetics should be used only for the condi tions for which they are intended For example a topicalanesthetic meant to relieve sunburn pain should not beused on cold sores Anyone who has had an unusual reaction to any local

repair a weak area in the aorta The aorta is the largestartery in the body and the main blood vessel leadingaway from the heart Purpose The purpose of aneurysmectomy is to repair an aor tic aneurysm that is likely to rupture if left in place Aneurysmectomy is indicated for an aortic aneurysm thatgrows to at least in cm or for an aortic aneurysm ofany size that is symptomatic tender or enlarging rapidly Precautions Aneurysmectomy may not be appropriate for patients with severely debilitating diseases such as can ceremphysema and heart failure Description An aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of the aorta that is usually due to arteriosclerosis or atherosclerosis People who are years old are most likely to develop an aortic aneurysm with men four times more likelyto develop one than women An aortic aneurysm develops and grows slowly It rarely produces symptoms and is usually only diagnosedby accident during a routine physical exam or on an x rayor ultrasound done for another reason As the aneurysmgrows larger the risk of bursting with no warning whichcauses catastrophic bleeding rises A ruptured aorticaneurysm can cause sudden loss of a fatal amount of bloodwithin minutes or it can leak in a series of small bleedsthat lead within hours or days to massive bleeding A leaking aortic aneurysm that is not treated is always fatalAneurysmectomy is performed to repair the two most common types of aortic aneurysms abdominal aortic aneurysms that occur in the abdomen below the kidneys and thoracic aortic aneurysms that occur in thechest It is major surgery performed in a hospital undergeneral anesthesia and involves removing debris andthen implanting a flexible tube graft to replace theenlarged artery Aneurysmectomy for an aneurysm of theascending aorta the first part of the aorta that travelsupward from the heart requires the use of a heartlungmachine that temporarily stops the heart while theaneurysm is repaired Aneurysmectomy requires a oneweek hospital stay the recovery period is five weeks During surgery the site of the aneurysm either the abdomen or the chest is opened with an incision to exposethe aneurysm The aorta is clamped above and below theaneurysm to stop the flow of blood Then an incision ismade in the aneurysm An artificial Dacron tube is sewn inplace above and below the opened aneurysm but theaneurysm is not removed Plaque or clotted blood arecleaned from the diseased tissue The clamps are removedand blood flow is reestablished through the graft Thewall of the aneurysm is wrapped around the graft to protect it and the skin of the abdomen or chest is sewn up Aneurysmectomy can be performed as elective or emergency surgery Elective aneurysmectomy takes aboutan hour and is far safer than emergency aneurysmectomywith a mortality rate of for elective abdominalaneurysmectomy and for elective thoracicaneurysmectomy When an aneurysm ruptures ofpatients die before they reach the hospital Of those whomake it into emergency aneurysmectromy die Aftera successful aneurysmectomy the patient has nearly thesame life expectancy as other people of the same age Preparation Before elective aneurysmectomy blood studies a chest x ray cardiac catherization electrocardiogram ECG and ultrasound are performed Aftercare After aneurysmectomy the patient is monitored in an Intensive Care Unit for the first hours Followup tests include ECG chest x ray and ultrasound Risks Elective aneurysmectomy has a rate of compli cations such as bleeding kidney failure respiratory complications heart attack stroke infection limb loss

that is caused by an insufficient supply ofblood ischemia to the heart muscle It is also some times characterized by a feeling of choking suffocation or crushing heaviness This condition is also called angina pectoris Description Often described as a muscle spasm and choking sen sation the term angina is used primarily to describechest thoracic pain originating from insufficient oxygento the heart muscle An episode of angina is not an actualheart attack but rather pain that results from the heart muscle temporarily receiving too little blood This temporary condition may be the result of demanding activities such as exercise and does not necessarily indicate that the heart muscle is experiencing permanent damageIn fact episodes of angina seldom cause permanent damage to heart muscle Angina can be subdivided further into two cate gories angina of effort and variant angina Angina of effort Angina of effort is a common disorder caused by the narrowing of the arteries atherosclerosis that supply oxygenrich blood to the heart muscle In the case ofangina of effort the heart coronary arteries can providethe heart muscle myocardium adequate blood duringrest but not during periods of exercise stress or excite mentany of which may precipitate pain The pain isrelieved by resting or by administering nitroglycerin amedication that reduces ischemia of the heart Patientswith angina of effort have an increased risk of heartattack myocardial infarction V ariant angina Variant angina is uncommon and occurs indepen dently of atherosclerosis which may however be presentas an incidental finding Variant angina occurs at rest andis not related to excessive work by the heart muscleResearch indicates that variant angina is caused by coro GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AnginaGEM to A PM Page nary artery muscle spasm of insufficient duration or intensity to cause an actual heart attack Causes and symptoms Angina causes a pressing pain or sensation of heavi ness usually in the chest area under the breast bone sternum It occasionally is experienced in the shoulder armneck or jaw regions Because episodes of angina occurwhen the hearts need for oxygen increases beyond theoxygen available from the blood nourishing the heart thecondition is often precipitated by physical exertion Inmost cases the symptoms are relieved within a few minutes by resting or by taking prescribed angina medications Emotional stress extreme temperatures heavymeals cigarette smoking and alcohol can also cause or contribute to an episode of angina Diagnosis Physicians can usually diagnose angina based on the patients symptoms and the precipitating factors However other diagnostic testing is often required to confirm orrule out angina or to determine the severity of the underlying heart disease Electrocardiogram ECG An electrocardiogram is a test that records electrical impulses from the heart The resulting graph of electricalactivity can show if the heart muscle isnt functioningproperly as a result of a lack of oxygen Electrocardiograms are also useful in investigating other possibleabnormal features of the heart Stress test For many individuals with angina the results of an electrocardiogram while at rest will not show any abnormalities Because the symptoms of angina occur duringstress the functioning of the heart may need to be evaluated under the physical stress of exercise The stress test records information from the electrocardiogram beforeduring and after exercise in search of stressrelatedabnormalities Blood pressure is also measured duringthe stress test and symptoms are noted A more involvedand complex stress test for example thallium scanningmay be used in some cases to picture the blood flow inthe heart muscle during the most intense time of exerciseand after rest Angiogram The angiogram which is basically an x ray of the coronary artery has been noted to be the most accuratediagnostic test to indicate the presence and extent of coronary disease In this procedure a long thin flexibletube catheter is maneuvered into an artery located inthe forearm or groin This catheter is passed furtherthrough the artery into one of the two major coronaryarteries A dye is injected at that time to help the x rayssee the heart and arteries more clearly Many brief xrays are made to create a movie of blood flowingthrough the coronary arteries which will reveal any possible narrowing that causes a decrease in blood flow tothe heart muscle and associated symptoms of angina Treatment Conservative treatment Artery disease causing angina is addressed initially by controlling existing factors placing the individual at riskThese risk factors include cigarette smoking high bloodpressure high cholesterol levels and obesity Angina is often controlled by medication most commonly withnitroglycerin This drug relieves symptoms of angina byincreasing the diameter of the blood vessels carryingblood to the heart muscle Nitroglycerin is taken wheneverdiscomfort occurs or is expected It may be taken bymouth by placing the tablet under the tongue or transdermally by placing a medicated patch directly on the skin Inaddition beta blockers or calcium channel blockers may be prescribed to also decrease the demand on theheart by decreasing the rate and workload of the heart Surgical treatment When conservative treatments are not effective in the reduction of angina pain and the risk of heart attackremains high physicians may recommend angioplasty or surgery Coronary artery bypass surgery is an operation in which a blood vessel often a long vein surgicallyremoved from the leg is grafted onto the blocked arteryto bypass the blocked portion This newly formed pathway allows blood to flow adequately to the heart muscle Another procedure used to improve blood flow to the heart is balloon angioplasty In this procedure thephysician inserts a catheter with a tiny balloon at the endinto a forearm or groin artery The catheter is then threaded up into the coronary arteries and the balloon is inflated to open the vessel in narrowed sections Other techniques using laser and mechanical devices are beingdeveloped and applied also by means of catheters Alternative treatment During an angina episode relief has been noted by applying massage or kinesiological methods but thesetechniques are not standard recommendations by physi GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AnginaGEM to A PM Page cians For example one technique places the palm and fingers of either hand on the forehead while simultaneously firmly massaging the sternum breast bone up anddown its entire length using the other hand This is followed by additional massaging by the fingertip andthumb next to the sternum on each side Once the angina has subsided the cause should be determined and treated Atherosclerosis a major associated cause requires diet and lifestyle adjustments primarily including regular exercise reduction of dietary sugarand saturated fats and increase of dietary fiber Both conventional and alternative medicine agree that increasingexercise and improving diet are important steps to reducehigh cholesterol levels Alternative medicine has proposed specific cholesterollowering treatments with several gaining the attention and interest of the public Oneof the most recent popular treatments is garlic Allium sativum Some studies have shown that adequate dosages of garlic can reduce total cholesterol by about LDLbad cholesterol by and raise HDL good cholesterol by Other studies have not shown significantbenefit Although its effect on cholesterol is not as greatas that achieved by medications garlic may possibly be ofbenefit in relatively mild cases of high cholesterol without causing the side effects associated with cholesterol reducing drugs Other herbal remedies that may help lower cholesterol include alfalfa Medicago sativa fenu greek Trigonella foenumgraecum Asian ginseng Panax ginseng and tumeric Curcuma longa Antioxidants including vitamin A beta carotene vitamin C vitamin E and selenium can limit the oxidative damage to the walls of blood vessels that may be aprecursor of atherosclerotic plaque formation Prognosis The prognosis for a patient with angina depends on its origin type severity and the general health of theindividual A person who has angina has the best prognosis if he or she seeks prompt medical attention and learnsthe pattern of his or her angina such as what causes theattacks what they feel like how long episodes usuallylast and whether medication relieves the attacks If patterns of the symptoms change significantly or if symptoms resemble those of a heart attack medical helpshould be sought immediately Prevention In most cases the best

Patients with kidney disease or injury may suffer further kidney damage from the contrast mediums usedfor angiography Patients who have blood clotting problems have a known allergy to contrast mediums or areallergic to iodine a component of some contrast mediums may also not be suitable candidates for an angiography procedure Because x rays carry risks of ionizingradiation exposure to the fetus pregnant women are alsoadvised to avoid this procedure Description Angiography is usually performed at a hospital by a trained radiologist and assisting technician or nurse Ittakes place in an xray or fluoroscopy suite and for mosttypes of angiograms the patients vital signs will bemonitored throughout the procedure Angiography requires the injection of a contrast dye that makes the blood vessels

vascular system is used to pilot the wire to thecorrect location Once it is in position the needle isremoved and a catheter is slid over the length of theguide wire until it to reaches the area of study The guidewire is removed and the catheter is left in place in preparation for the injection of the contrast medium or dye Depending on the type of angiography procedure being performed the contrast medium is either injectedby hand with a syringe or is mechanically injected withan automatic injector connected to the catheter Anautomatic injector is used frequently because it is ableto propel a large volume of dye very quickly to theangiogram site The patient is warned that the injectionwill start and instructed to remain very still The injection causes some mild to moderate discomfort Possibleside effects or reactions include headache dizziness irregular heartbeat nausea warmth burning sensationand chest pain but they usually last only momentarily To view the area of study from different angles or perspectives the patient may be asked to change positionsseveral times and subsequent dye injections may beadministered During any injection the patient or thecamera may move Throughout the dye injection procedure xray pic tures andor fluoroscopic pictures or moving x rays willbe taken Because of the high pressure of arterial bloodflow the dye will dissipate through

Pressure isapplied to the site with a sandbag or other weight for minutes in order for clotting to take place and thearterial puncture to reseal itself A pressure bandage isthen applied Most angiograms follow the general procedures out lined above but vary slightly depending on the area ofthe vascular system being studied A variety of commonangiography procedures are outlined below Cerebral angiography Cerebral angiography is used to detect aneurysms blood clots and other vascular irregularities in the brainThe catheter is inserted into the femoral or carotid arteryand the injected contrast medium travels through theblood vessels on the brain Patients frequently experienceheadache warmth or a burning sensation in the head orneck during the injection portion of the procedure Acerebral angiogram takes two to four hours to complete Coronary angiography Coronary angiography is administered by a cardiol ogist with training in radiology or occasionally by aradiologist The arterial puncture is typically given in thefemoral artery and the cardiologist uses a guide wire andcatheter to perform a contrast injection and xray serieson the coronary arteries The catheter may also be placedin the left ventricle to examine the mitral and aorticvalves of the heart If the cardiologist requires a view ofthe right ventricle of the heart or of the tricuspid or pulmonic valves the catheter will be inserted through alarge vein and guided into the right ventricle Thecatheter also serves the purpose of monitoring bloodpressures in these different locations inside the heart Theangiogram procedure takes several hours depending onthe complexity of the procedure Pulmonary angiography Pulmonary or lung angiography is performed to evaluate blood circulation to the lungs It is also considered the most accurate diagnostic test for detecting a pul monary embolism The procedure differs from cerebral and coronary angiograms in that the guide wire andcatheter are inserted into a vein instead of an artery andare guided up through the chambers of the heart and intothe pulmonary artery Throughout the procedure thepatients vital signs are monitored to ensure that thecatheter doesnt cause arrhythmias or irregular heartbeats The contrast medium is then injected into the pul monary artery where it circulates through the lung capillaries The test typically takes up to minutes Kidney angiography Patients with chronic renal disease or injury can suf fer further damage to their kidneys from the contrastmedium used in a kidney angiogram yet they oftenrequire the test to evaluate kidney function Thesepatients should be wellhydrated with a intravenoussaline drip before the procedure and may benefit fromavailable medications eg dopamine that help to protect the kidney from further injury due to contrast agentsDuring a kidney angiogram the guide wire and catheterare inserted into the femoral artery in the groin area andadvanced through the abdominal aorta the main artery inthe abdomen and into the renal arteries The procedurewill take approximately one hour Fluorescein angiography Fluorescein angiography is used to diagnose retinal problems and circulatory disorders It is typically conducted as an outpatient procedure The patients pupilsare dilated with eye drops and he rests his chin and forehead against a bracing apparatus to keep it still Sodiumfluorescein dye is then injected with a syringe into a veinin the patients arm The dye will travel through thepatients body and into the blood vessels of the eye Theprocedure does not require x rays Instead a rapid seriesof closeup photographs of the patients eyes are takenone set immediately after the dye is injected and a second set approximately minutes later once the dye hasmoved through the patients vascular system The entireprocedure takes up to one hour Celiac and mesenteric angiography Celiac and mesenteric angiography involves xray exploration of the celiac and mesenteric arteries arterialbranches of the abdominal aorta that supply blood to theabdomen and digestive system The test is commonlyused to detect aneurysm thrombosis and signs ofischemia in the celiac and mesenteric arteries and to locate the source of gastrointestinal bleeding It is alsoused in the diagnosis of a number of conditions including portal hypertension and cirrhosis The procedure can take up to three hours depending on the number ofblood vessels studied Splenoportography A splenoportograph is a variation of an angiogram that involves the injection of contrast medium

complication of an arterial puncture an overnight stayin the hospital is sometimes recommended following anangiography procedure particularly with cerebral andcoronary angiograms If the procedure is performed on anoutpatient basis the patient is typically kept under closeobservation for a period of at six to hours before beingreleased If the arterial puncture was performed in thefemoral artery the patient will be instructed to keep hisleg straight and relatively immobile during the observation period The patients blood pressure and vital signswill be monitored and the puncture site observed closelyPain medication may be prescribed if the patient is experiencing discomfort from the puncture and a cold pack isapplied to the site to reduce swelling It is normal for thepuncture site to be sore and bruised for several weeks GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AngiographyGEM to A PM Page The patient may also develop a hematoma a hard mass created by the blood vessels broken during the procedureHematomas should be watched carefully as they mayindicate continued bleeding of the arterial puncture site Angiography patients are also advised to enjoy two to three days of rest and relaxation after the procedure inorder to avoid placing any undue stress on the arterial puncture Patients who experience continued bleeding orabnormal swelling of the puncture site sudden dizzinessor chest pains in the days following an angiography procedure should seek medical attention immediately Patients undergoing a fluorescein angiography should not drive or expose their eyes to direct sunlightfor hours following the procedure Risks Because angiography involves puncturing an artery internal bleeding or hemorrhage are possible complications of the test As with any invasive procedure infection of the puncture site or bloodstream is also a risk butthis is rare A stroke or heart attack may be triggered by an angiogram if blood clots or plaque on the inside of thearterial wall are dislodged by the catheter and form ablockage in the blood vessels or artery The heart mayalso become irritated by the movement of the catheterthrough its chambers during pulmonary and coronaryangiography procedures and arrhythmias may develop Patients who develop an allergic reaction to the con trast medium used in angiography may experience a variety of symptoms including swelling difficulty breathingheart failure or a sudden drop in blood pressure If the patient is aware of the allergy before the test isadministered certain medications can be administered atthat time to counteract the reaction Angiography involves minor exposure to radiation through the x rays and fluoroscopic guidance used in theprocedure Unless the patient is pregnant or multipleradiological or fluoroscopic studies are required thesmall dose of radiation incurred during a single procedure poses little risk However multiple studies requiringfluoroscopic exposure that are conducted in a short timeperiod have been known to cause skin necrosis in someindividuals This risk can be minimized by careful monitoring and documentation of cumulative radiation dosesadministered to these patients Normal results The results of an angiogram or arteriogram depend on the artery or organ system being examined Generallytest results should display a normal and unimpeded flow of blood through the vascular system Fluoresceinangiography should result in no leakage of fluoresceindye through the retinal blood vessels Abnormal results Abnormal results of an angiography may display a restricted blood vessel or arterial blood flow ischemiaor an irregular placement or location of blood vesselsThe results of an angiography vary widely by the type ofprocedure performed and should be interpreted

seeBirthmarks Angioplasty Definition Angioplasty is a term describing a procedure used to widen vessels narrowed by stenoses or occlusions Thereare various types of these procedures and their names areassociated with the type of vessel entry and equipmentused For example percutaneous transluminal angioplastyPTA describes entry through the skin percutaneous andnavigates to the area of the vessel of interest through thesame vessel or one that communicates with it transluminal In the case of a procedure involving the coronaryarteries the point of entry could be the femoral artery in thegroin and the catheterguidewire system is passed throughthe aorta to the heart and the origin of the coronary arteriesat the base of the aorta just outside the aortic valve Purpose In individuals with an occulsive vascular disease such as atherosclerosis blood flow is impaired to an organ such as the heart or to a distal body part such asthe lower leg by the narrowing of the vessels lumen dueto fatty deposits or calcium accumulation This narrowing may occur in any vessel but may occur anywhereOnce the vessel has been widened adequate blood flowis returned The vessel may narrow again over time at thesame location and the procedure could be repeated GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AngioplastyGEM to A PM Page Precautions Angioplasty procedures are performed on hospital inpatients in facilities for proper monitoring and recovery If the procedure is to be performed in a coronaryartery the patients care is likely to be provided by specially trained physicians nurses and vascular specialistsTypically patients are given anticoagulants prior to theprocedure to assist in the prevention of thrombosesblood clots Administration of anticoagulants howevermay impede the sealing of the vascular entry point Theprocedure will be performed using fluoroscopic guidanceand contrast media Since the decision to perform angioplasty may have been made following a diagnosticangiogram the patients sensitivity to iodinated contrastmedia is likely to known The procedure may thenrequire the use of nonionic contrast agents Description Angioplasty was originally performed by dilating the vessel with the introduction of larger and larger stiffcatheters through the narrowed space Complications ofthis procedure caused researchers to develop means ofwidening the vessel using a minimally sized deviceToday catheters contain balloons that are inflated to widenthe vessel and stents to provide structural support for thevessel Lasers may be used to assist in the break up of thefat or calcium plaque Catheters may also be equippedwith spinning wires or drill tips to clean out the plaque Angioplasty may be performed while the patient is sedated or anesthetized depending on the vesselsinvolved If a percutaneous transluminal coronary angio plasty PTCA is to be performed the patient will bekept awake to report on discomfort and cough if required PTCA procedures are performed in cardiac catheterization labs with sophisticated monitoring devices If angioplasty is performed in the radiologydepartments angiographic suite the patient may besedated for the procedure and a nurse will monitor thepatients vital signs during the procedure If performedby a vascular surgeon the angioplasty procedure will beperformed in an operating room or specially designedvascular procedure suite The site of the introduction of the angioplasty equip ment is prepared as a sterile surgical site Although manyprocedures are performed by puncturing the vesselthrough skin many procedures are also performed bysurgically exposing the site of entry Direct view of thevessels puncture site aids in monitoring damage to thevessel or excessive bleeding at the site Once the vessel ispunctured and the guidewire is introduced fluoroscopyis used to monitor small injections of contrast media usedto visualize the path through the vessel If the fluoroscopy system has a feature called roadmap theamount of contrast media injected will be greater in orderto define the full route the guidewire will take The fluoroscopy system will then superimpose subsequentimages over the roadmap while the vessel is traversedthat is the physician moves the guidewire along the mapto the destination Having reached the area of stenosis the physician will inflate the balloon on the catheter that has been

by the inflation of the balloon device Illustration by Argosy IncGEM to A PM Page passed along the guidewire Balloons are inflated in size and duration depending on the size and location of thevessel In some cases the use of a stent a mesh of wirethat resembles a Chinese finger puzzle may also beused The vessel may be widened before during or afterthe deployment of the stent Procedures for deployingstents are dependent on the type of stent used In caseswhere the vessel is tortuous or at intersections of vesselsthe use of a graph may be necessary to provide structuralstrength to the vessel Stents graphs and balloon dilation may all be used together or separately The procedure is verified using fluoroscopy and contrast media to produce an angiogram or by usingintravascular ultrasound or both All equipment is withdrawn from the vessel and the puncture site repaired Risks During the procedure there is a danger of puncturing the vessel with the guidewire This is a very small riskPatients must be monitored for hematoma or hemorrhageat the puncture site There is also a small risk of heart attack emboli and although unlikely death Hospital ization will vary in length

inhibitors also called ACE inhibitors are medicines that block the conversion of the chemical angiotensin I to a substance thatincreases salt and water retention in the body Purpose ACE inhibitors are used in the treatment of high blood pressure They may be used alone or in combination with other medicines for high blood pressure Theywork by preventing a chemical in the blood angiotensinI from being converted into a substance that increasessalt and water retention in the body Increased salt andwater retention lead to high blood pressure ACEinhibitors also make blood vessels relax which helpslower blood pressure and allows more oxygenrich bloodto reach the heart GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitorsGEM to A PM Page Treating high blood pressure is important because the condition puts a burden on the heart and the arterieswhich can lead to permanent damage over time Ifuntreated high blood pressure increases the risk of heartattacks heart failure stroke or kidney failure ACE inhibitors may also be prescribed for other conditions For example captopril Capoten is used totreat kidney problems in people who take insulin to control diabetes

isbeing taken Check with the physician who prescribedthe drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription forthe correct dosage This medicine may take weeks to noticeably lower blood pressure Take it exactly as directed Do not stop taking this medicine without checking with the physician who prescribed it Precautions A person taking an ACE inhibitor should see a physician regularly The physician will check the bloodpressure to make sure the medicine is working as itshould and will note any unwanted side effects Peoplewho have high blood pressure often feel perfectly fineHowever they should continue to see their physicianseven when they feel well so that the physician can keepa close watch on their condition It is also important forpatients to keep taking their medicine even when theyfeel fine ACE inhibitors will not cure high blood pressure but will help control the condition To avoid the serioushealth problems that high blood pressure can cause patients may have to take medicine for the rest of theirlives Furthermore medicine alone may not be enoughPatients with high blood pressure may also need to avoidcertain foods such as salty snacks and keep their weightunder control The health care professional who is treating the condition can offer advice on what measures maybe necessary Patients being treated for high blood pressure should not change their diets without consulting their physicians Anyone taking this medicine for high blood pressure should not take any other prescription or overthecounter OTC medicine without first checking with hisor her physician Some medicines such as certain coldremedies may increase blood pressure Some people feel dizzy or lightheaded after taking the first dose of an ACE inhibitor especially if theyhave been

checking with the physi cian who prescribed this medicine Captopril and moexipril should be taken one hour before meals Other ACE inhinbitors may be taken withor without meals Avoid overheating when exercising or in hot weather The loss of water from the body through heavy sweating can cause low blood pressure Check with a physician right away if illness occurs while taking an ACE inhibitor This is especially true ifthe illness involves severe nausea vomiting or diar rhea V omiting and diarrhea can cause the loss of too much water from the body which can lead to low bloodpressure Anyone who

ACE test is used primarily to detect and monitor the clinical course of sarcoidosis a disease that affects many organs especially the lungs to differentiatebetween sarcoidosis and similar diseases and to delineate between active and inactive sarcoid disease Elevated ACE levels are also found in a number of other conditions including Gauchers disease a rare familial disorder of fat metabolism and

that may cause decreased ACE levelsinclude ACE inhibitor antihypertensives and steroids Description ACE plays an important role in the reninaldosterone mechanism which controls blood pressure by convertingangiotensin I to angiotensin II two proteins involved inregulating blood pressure Angiotensin I by itself is inactive but when converted by ACE to the active formangiotensin II it causes narrowing of the small bloodvessels in tissues resulting in an increase in blood pressure Angiotensin II also stimulates the hormone aldosterone which causes an increase in blood pressure Certain kidney disorders increase the production ofangiotensin II another cause of hypertension Despite the action of ACE on blood pressure regulation determination of this enzyme is not very helpful in the evaluationof hypertension high blood pressure Preparation Determination of ACE levels requires a blood sam ple The patient need not be fasting Risks Risks for this test are minimal but may include

bites make up of all reported incidents Cats account for about of reported bites and otheranimals including rodents rabbits horses raccoonsbats skunks and monkeys make up the remaining Cat bites become infected more frequently thandog bites A dogs mouth is rich in bacteria but only of dog bites become infected In contrast approximately of cat bites become infected Many factors contribute to the infection rates such as for example the type of wound inflicted the locationof the wound preexisting health conditions in the bittenperson the extent of delay before treatment patient compliance and the presence of a foreign body in the woundDogs usually inflict crush injuries because they haverounded teeth and strong jaws thus the bite of an adultdog can exert up to pounds per square inch of pressure This pressure usually results in a crushing injurycausing damage to deep structures such as bones bloodvessels tendons muscles and nerves Dog canine teethare also sharp and strong and also inflict lacerationsCats with their needlelike fangs typically cause puncture wounds Puncture wounds appear innocuous on the surface but the underlying injury goes deep Cat teethessentially inject

the spine AS is also known as rheumatoidspondylitis or MarieStrmpell disease among othernames Description A form of arthritis AS is characterized by chronic inflammation causing pain and stiffness of the back GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Ankylosing spondylitisGEM to A PM Page progressing to the chest and neck Eventually the whole back may become curved and inflexible if the bones fusethis is known as bamboo spine AS is a systemic disorder that may involve multiple organs such as the eye causing an inflammation of the iris or iritis heart causing aortic valve disease lungs skin causing a scaly skin condition or psoriasis gastrointestinal tract causing inflammation within the small intestine called ileitis or inflammation of thelarge intestine called colitis Less than of the population has AS however of AS sufferers have a relative with the disorder Causes and symptoms Genetics play an important role in the disease but the cause of AS is still unknown More than ofpatients have a gene called HLAB but only of those who inherit the gene develop the disease Symptoms of AS include low back and hip pain and stiffness difficulty expanding the chest pain in the neck shoulders knees and ankles lowgrade fever fatigue weight loss AS is seen most commonly in males years old and older Initial symptoms are uncommon after the ageof although the diagnosis may not be establisheduntil after that age The incidence of AS in AfroAmericans is about of the incidence in Caucasians Diagnosis Doctors usually diagnose the disease simply by the patients report of pain and stiffness Doctors also reviewspinal and pelvic x rays since involvement of the hip andpelvic joints is common and may be the first abnormalityseen on the x ray The doctor may also order a blood testto determine the presence of HLAB antigen When adiagnosis is made patients may be referred to a rheumatologist a doctor who specializes in treating arthritisPatients may also be referred to an orthopedic surgeon adoctor who can surgically correct joint or bone disorders Treatment Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs like naproxen Naprosyn or indomethacin Indocin areused to relieve pain and stiffness In severe cases sul fasalazine Azulfidine another drug to reduce inflammation or methotrexate Rheumatrex an immunesuppressing drug is recommended In cases where chronictherapy is needed potential drug side effects must betaken into consideration Corticosteroid drugs are effective in relieving symptoms but are usually reserved forsevere cases that do not improve when NSAIDs are usedTo avoid potential side effects treatment with corticos teroids is usually limited to a short amount of time with a gradual weaning from the drug Physical therapists prescribe exercises to prevent a stooped posture and breathing problems when the spinestarts to fuse and ribs are affected Back braces may beused to prevent continued deformity of the spine andribs Only in severe cases of deformity is surgery performed to straighten and realign the spine or to replaceknee shoulder or hip joints Alternative treatment To reduce inflammation various herbal remedies including white willow Salix alba yarrow Achillea millefolium and lobelia Lobelia inflata may be help ful Acupuncture performed by a trained professional has helped some patients manage their pain Homeopathic practitioners may prescribe such remedies as Bryonia and Rhus toxicodendron for pain relief Prognosis There is no cure for AS and the course of the disease is unpredictable Generally AS progresses for about years and

medical disorders that occur at the junction of the anal canal and the rectum Description The anal canal also called the anus is the opening at the bottom end of the digestive tract and is a combinationof external skin and tissue from the digestive tract It hasmany sensory nerves and is sensitive to pain The rectum is the last section of the digestive tract and has a mucuslayer as its inside surface It has very few sensory nervesand is therefore relatively insensitive to pain The analcanal has a ring of muscle called the anal sphincterwhich keeps the anus closed There are a number of different anorectal disordersKEY TERMS Ankylosing When bones of a joint are fused stiff or rigid HLAB An antigen or protein marker on cells that may indicate ankylosing spondylitis Immune suppressing Anything that reduces the activity of the immune system Inflammation A reaction of tissues to disease or injury often associated with pain and swelling Spondylitis An inflammation of the spineCauses and symptoms Hemorrhoids are swollen or varicose veins in the anal canal and rectum They may become inflamedenlarged or protrude from the anorectal area Hemorrhoids may bleed when passing a bowel movement Theamount of bleeding is typically small Frequently hemorrhoids develop because of straining during bowelmovements especially if the person has constipation An anal fissure is a tear in the lining of the anus that is usually caused by a hard bowel movement Fissuresare painful and bleed when the tissue is stressed duringbowel movements Anorectal abscesses are characterized by pusform ing infections in the anorectal region Painful abscessesform under the skin An anorectal fistula is an abnormal opening or chan nel from the anorectal area to another part of the bodyTypically the channel leads to pockets of skin near theanus When seen in infants anorectal fistulas are considered birth defects These are seen more frequently in boys than in girls Fistulas are also seen more frequentlyin people who have other diseases including Crohns disease tuberculosis cancer and diverticulitis Anorec tal fistulas also occur following anorectal abscesses orother injury to the anal area Fistulas are usually painfuland discharge pus Proctitis is an inflammation of the internal mucosal lining of the rectum Ulcers of the lining may form anddevelop into ulcerative colitis There are many causes of proctitis including the sexually transmitted diseases chlamydia and herpes simplex infections Proctitis is frequently seen in homosexual males as a consequence ofanorectal infection Proctitis itself is not painful but painmay be caused by the infectious agent Diagnosis Diagnosis is made by visual inspection of the skin around the anus Also the doctor may probe the rectumwith a gloved finger An anoscope is a short instrumentthat allows the physician to view the inside of the anus Aproctoscope is a longer rigid viewing tube of approximately six to ten inches in length which

eating disorder characterized by unrealistic fear of weight gain selfstarvation andconspicuous distortion of body image The name comesfrom two Latin words that mean nervous inability to eatIn females who have begun to menstruate anorexia nervosa is usually marked by amenorrhea or skipping at least three menstrual periods in a row The fourth editionof the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis orders or DSMIV defines two subtypes of anorexia nervosaa restricting type characterized bystrict dieting and exercise without binge eating and a bingeeatingpurging type marked by episodes of compulsive eating with or without selfinduced vomiting andthe use of laxatives or enemas DSMIV defines a binge as a timelimited usually under two hours episode ofcompulsive eating in which the individual consumes asignificantly larger amount of food than most peoplewould eat in similar circumstances Description Anorexia nervosa was not officially classified as a psychiatric disorder until the third edition of DSM in It is however a growing problem among adoles cent females Its incidence in the United States has doubled since The rise in the number of reported casesreflects a genuine increase in the number of personsaffected by the disorder and not simply earlier or moreaccurate diagnosis Estimates of the incidence of anorexia range between of caucasian female adolescents Over of patients diagnosed with the disorderas of are female It was originally thought that only of anorexics are male but that estimate is beingrevised upward The peak age range for onset of the disorder is years although there are patients whodevelop anorexia as late as their s In the s ands anorexia was regarded as a disorder of upper andmiddleclass women but that generalization is alsochanging More recent studies indicate that anorexia isincreasingly common among women of all races andsocial classes in the United States Anorexia nervosa is a serious public health problem not only because of its rising incidence but also becauseit has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatricdisorder Moreover the disorder may cause serious longterm health complications including congestive heart failure sudden death growth retardation dental prob lems constipation stomach rupture swelling of the salivary glands anemia and other abnormalities of theblood loss of kidney function and osteoporosis Causes and symptoms Anorexia is a disorder that results from the interac tion of cultural and interpersonal as well as biologicalfactors While the precise cause of the disease is notknown it has been linked to the following Social influences The rising incidence of anorexia is thought to reflect the present idealization of thinness as a badge of upperclass status as well as of female beauty In addition theincrease in cases of anorexia includes copycat behavior with some patients developing the disorder from imitating other girls The onset of anorexia in adolescence is attributed to a developmental crisis caused by girls changing bodiescoupled with societys overemphasis on womens looksThe increasing influence of the mass media in spreadingand reinforcing gender stereotypes has also been noted Occupational goals The risk of developing anorexia is higher among adolescents preparing for careers that require attention toweight andor appearance These highrisk groups GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Anorectal disordersGEM to A PM Page include dancers fashion models professional athletes including gymnasts skaters longdistance runners andjockeys and actresses Genetic and biological influences Women whose biological mothers or sisters have the disorder appear to be at increased risk Psychological factors A number of theories have been advanced to explain the psychological aspects of the disorder No singleexplanation covers all cases Anorexia nervosa has beeninterpreted as A rejection of female sexual maturity This rejection is variously interpreted as a desire to remain a child or asa desire to resemble men as closely as possible A reaction to sexual abuse or assault A desire to appear as fragile and nonthreatening as pos sible This hypothesis reflects the idea that female passivity and weakness are attractive to men Overemphasis on control autonomy and indepen dence Some anorexics come from achievementoriented families that stress physical fitness and dieting Many anorexics are perfectionistic and driven aboutschoolwork and other matters in addition to weightcontrol Evidence of family dysfunction In some families a daughters eating disorder serves as a distraction frommarital discord or other family tensions Inability to interpret the bodys hunger signals accu rately due to early experiences of inappropriate feeding Male anorexics Although anorexia nervosa is still considered a dis order that largely affects women its incidence in themale population is rising Less is known about the causesof anorexia in males but some risk factors are the sameas for females These include certain occupational goalsand increasing media emphasis on external appearance inmen Moreover homosexual males are under pressure toconform to an ideal body weight that is about poundslighter than the standard attractive weight for heterosexual males Diagnosis Diagnosis of anorexia nervosa is complicated by a number of factors One is that the disorder varies somewhat in severity from patient to patient A second factoris denial which is regarded as an early sign of the disorder Most anorexics deny that they are ill and are usually brought to treatment by a family member Most anorexics are diagnosed by pediatricians or family practitioners Anorexics develop emaciated bodies dry or yellowish skin and abnormally low bloodpressure There is usually a history of amenorrhea failure to menstruate in females and sometimes of abdominal pain constipation or lack of energy The patient may feel chilly or have developed lanugo a growth of downybody hair If the patient has been vomiting she may haveeroded tooth enamel or Russells sign scars on the backof the hand The second step in diagnosis is measurement of the patients weight loss DSMIV specifies a weight loss leading to a body weight below normalwith some allowance for body build and weight history The doctor will need to rule out other physical condi tions that can cause weight loss or vomiting after eatingincluding metabolic disorders brain tumors especiallyhypothalamus and pituitary gland lesions diseases of thedigestive tract and a condition called superior mesentericartery syndrome Persons with this condition sometimesvomit after meals because the blood supply to the intestine is blocked The doctor will usually order blood testsan electrocardiogram urinalysis and bone densitometry bone density test in order to exclude other diseases and to assess the patients nutritional status The doctor will also need to distinguish between anorexia and other psychiatric disorders including depression schizophrenia social phobia obsessivecompulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder Two diagnostic tests that are often used are the Eating Attitudes TestEAT and the Eating Disorder Inventory EDI Treatment Treatment of anorexia nervosa includes both short and longterm measures and requires assessment bydietitians and psychiatrists as well as medical specialistsTherapy is often complicated by the patients resistanceor failure to carry out treatment plan Hospital treatment Hospitalization is recommended for anorexics with any of the following characteristics weight of or more below normal or weight loss over a threemonth period of more than pounds severely disturbed metabolism severe binging and purging signs of psychosis severe depression or risk of suicide family in crisis GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Anorectal disordersGEM to A PM Page Hospital treatment includes individual and group therapy as well as refeeding and monitoring of the patients physical condition Treatment usually requirestwo to four months in the hospital In extreme cases hospitalized patients may be forcefed through a tube inserted in the nose nasogastric tube or by overfeedinghyperalimentation techniques Outpatient treatment Anorexics who are not severely malnourished can be treated by outpatient psychotherapy The types of treatment recommended are supportive rather than insightoriented and include behavioral approaches as well as individual or group therapy Family therapy is often recom mended when the patients eating disorder is closely tiedto family dysfunction Selfhelp groups are often useful inhelping anorexics find social support and encouragementPsychotherapy with anorexics is a slow and difficultprocess about of patients continue to have seriouspsychiatric problems after their weight has stabilized Medications Anorexics have been treated with a variety of med ications including antidepressants antianxiety drugs selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and lithium carbonate The effectiveness of medications in treatmentregimens is still debated However at least one study ofProzac showed it helped the patient maintain weightgained while in the hospital Prognosis Figures for longterm recovery vary from study to study but the most reliable estimates are that ofanorexics will make a good physical and social recoveryand will gain weight The longterm mortality ratefor anorexia is estimated at around although somestudies give a lower figure of The most frequentcauses of death associated with anorexia

pain hemorrhoids rectal prolapse digital rectal examination that shows a mass perianal abscess and condyloma a wartlike growth An anascopy maybe performed to check for abnormal openings betweenthe anus and the skin or anal fissures The test is alsoused to diagnose rectal cancer Precautions Anoscopy should not be performed on patients with acute cardiovascular problems due to the vasovagal reaction it may cause This test is also not recommended forpatients with acute abdominal problems and those with aconstricted or narrowed anal canal Description Anoscopy views the anus and anal canal by using an anoscope An anoscope is a plastic tubeshaped speculum that is a smaller version of a sigmoidscope Beforethe anoscope is used the doctor completes a digital rectalexamination with a lubricated gloved index finger Theanoscope is then lubricated and gently inserted a fewinches into the rectum This procedure enlarges the rectum to allow the doctor to view the entire anal canal witha light If any suspicious areas are noticed a piece of tissue can be biopsied During the anoscopy procedure there may be a feel ing of pressure or the need to go to the bathroom If abiopsy is taken the patient may feel a slight pinch Theprocedure is performed on an outpatient basis and takesapproximately an hour to complete Preparation The patient will be instructed to clear their rectum of stool

of smell Ageusia acompanion word refers to a lack of taste sensationPatients who actually have anosmia may complainwrongly of ageusia although they retain the ability todistinguish salt sweet sour and bitterhumans onlytaste sensations Description Of the five senses smell ranks fourth in importance for humans although it is much more pronounced inother animals Bloodhounds for example can smell anodor a thousand times weaker than humans Taste considered the fifth sense is mostly the smell of food in themouth The sense of smell originates from the first cranialnerves the olfactory nerves which sit at the base of thebrains frontal lobes right behind the eyes and above thenose Inhaled airborne chemicals stimulate these nerves There are other aberrations of smell beside a decrease Smells can be distorted intensified or hallucinated These changes usually indicate a malfunction ofthe brain Causes and symptoms The most common cause of anosmia is nasal occlu sion caused by rhinitis inflammation of the nasal mem branes If no air gets to the olfactory nerves smell willnot happen In turn rhinitis and nasal polyps growths on nasal membranes are caused by irritants such asallergens infections cigarette smoke and other air pollutants Tumors such as nasal polyps can also block thenasal passages and the olfactory nerves and cause anosmia Head injury or rarely certain viral infections can damage or destroy the olfactory nervesDiagnosis It is difficult to measure a loss of smell and no one complains of loss of smell in just one nostril So a physician usually begins by testing each nostril separatelywith a common nonirritating odor such as perfumelemon vanilla or coffee Polyps and rhinitis are obviouscausal agents a physician looks for Imaging studies ofthe head may be necessary in order to detect brain injurysinus infection or tumor Treatment Cessation of smoking is the first step Many smok ers who quit discover new tastes so enthusiastically thatthey immediately gain weight Attention to reducingexposure to other nasal irritants and treatment of respiratory allergies or chronic upper respiratory infections will be beneficial Corticosteroids are particularly helpful Alternative treatment Finding and treating the cause of the loss of smell is the first approach in naturopathic medicine If rhinitis is the cause treating acute rhinitis with herbal mast cellstabilizers and herbal decongestants can offer some relief as the body heals If chronic rhinitis is present thisis often related to an environmental irritant or to foodallergies Removal of the causative factors is the first stepto healing Nasal steams with essential oils offer relief ofthe blockage and tonification of the membranes Blockages can sometimes be resolved through nasospecifictherapya way of realigning the nasal cavities Polypblockage can be addressed through botanical medicinetreatment as well as hydrotherapy Olfactory nerve damage may not be regenerable Some olfactory aberrations like intensified sense of smell can be resolvedusing homeopathic medicine Prognosis If nasal inflammation is the cause of anosmia the chances of recovery are excellent However if

Anoxemia seeAnoxia Anoxia Definition Anoxia is a condition characterized by an absence of oxygen supply to an organ or a tissue Description Anoxia results when oxygen is not being delivered to a part of the body If the condition does not involve totaloxygen deprivation it is often called hypoxia althoughthe two terms have been used interchangeably A relatedcondition anoxemia occurs when the blood circulatesbut contains a below normal amount of oxygen The five types of anoxia or hypoxia include hypox emic anemic affinity stagnant and histotoxic Hypoxemic anoxia happens when the oxygen pressure outsidethe body is so low that the hemoglobin the chemicalwhich carries oxygen in the red blood cells RBCs isunable to become fully loaded with the gas This results intoo little oxygen reaching the tissues and can occur in suffocation when a person is at high altitude where the pressure of oxygen in the air is much less than at sea level Anemic anoxia results from a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin or RBCs in the blood whichreduces the ability to get oxygen to the tissues Anemiamay result from lack of production of red blood cellsKEY TERMS Allergen Any substance that irritates only those who are sensitive allergic to it Corticosteroids Cortisone prednisone and related drugs that reduce inflammation Rhinitis Inflammation and swelling of the nasal membranes Nasal polyps Dropshaped overgrowths of the nasal membranesiron deficiency blood loss hemorrhage or shortened lifespan of red blood cells autoimmune disease Affinity anoxia involves a defect in the chemistry of the blood such that the hemoglobin can no longer pick upas much oxygen from the air even though the quantitiesare normal reducing how much is delivered to the tissues Stagnant anoxia occurs when there is interference with the blood flow although the blood and its oxygencarrying abilities are normal A common cause of generalstagnant anoxia is heart disease or interference with thereturn of blood flow through the veins Examples of localstagnant anoxia include exposure to cold diseases thatrestrict circulation to the extremities and ergot poison ing When the tissue or organ itself has a reduced ability to accept and use the oxygen it is called histotoxic anoxia The classic example is cyanide poisoning where thechemical inactivates a cellular enzyme necessary for thecell to use oxygen Thus tissue exposed to cyanide cannot use the oxygen even though it is in normal amountsin the bloodstream Histotoxic anoxia can also be causedby exposure to narcotics alcohol formaldehyde acetone toluene and certain anesthetic agents Causes and symptoms Anoxia and hypoxia can be caused by any number of disease states of the blood lungs heart and circulationincluding heart attack severe asthma or emphysema It can also result from smoke or carbon monoxide inhalation improper exposure to anesthesia poisoning strangulation neardrowning or high altitude exposure through mountain climbing or travel in an insufficiently pressurized airplane Anoxia and the resultant brain damage is aparticular problem with newborns during difficult births No matter what the cause of anoxia the symptoms are similar In severe cases the patient is often confusedand commonly stuperous or comatose in a state ofunconsciousness Depending on the severity of the injuryto the brain the organ most sensitive to reduced oxygenintake this condition can persist for hours days weeksor even months or years Seizures myoclonic jerks involuntary muscle spasms or twitches and neck stiffness aresome other symptoms of the anoxic condition Symptoms of more localized or less complete oxygen deprivation hypoxia include increased breathing ratelightheadedness dizziness tingling or warm sensation sweating reduced field of vision sleepiness a bluish tintto skin particularly the fingertips and lips and behaviorchanges often an inappropriate sense of euphoria Diagnosis Diagnosis of anoxia and hypoxia is commonly made through the appearance of clinical symptoms However GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AnoxiaGEM to A PM Page suspected reduction in oxygen reaching the tissues can be confirmed using laboratory tests The exact test that isperformed is dependent on the suspected cause of theanoxia One systemic measure of tissue anoxia is theserum lactate lactic acid test When cells are forced toproduce energy without oxygen as would happen duringanoxia lactic acid is one of the byproducts Thus anincrease in lactic acid in the blood would indicate that tissues were starved for oxygen and are using nonoxygenpathways to produce energy Normally the blood contains less than mmolL of lactic acid However someforms of anoxia do not increase lactic acid concentrationsin the blood and some increases in lactic acid levels arenot associated with anoxia so an elevated value for thistest is only suggestive of an anoxic or hypoxic condition Treatment The exact treatment for anoxia is dependent on the cause of the reduced oxygen reaching the tissues However immediate restoration of tissue oxygen levelsthrough supplementing the patients air supply with oxygen is a common first step Secondary stepsoften include support of the cardiovascular systemthrough drugs or other treatment treatment of lung disease transfusions or administration of anecdotes for poisoning as appropriate Prognosis A good prognosis is dependent on the ability to treat the underlying cause of the low oxygen levels If cardiovascular and respiratory systems can be supported adequately recovery from the injury to the tissue is possiblealthough extent of injury to the brain can be difficult toassess The exact amount of recovery varies with theamount of injury sustained where significant injury bringsa poorer prognosis As recovery occurs both psychological and neurological abnormalities may appear persistand can improve Some problems seen after anoxiainclude mental confusion personality changes amnesia or other types of memory loss hallucinations and persis tent myoclonus involuntary contractions of the muscles Prevention Hypoxemic anoxia can be avoided by utilizing sup plemental oxygen when in high altitudes and beingaware of the early symptoms of altitude sickness and reducing altitude once recognized Iron supplements canavoid anemic hypoxia although more severe anemicstates are usually caused by disease or bleeding Maintaining good cardiovascular health through proper dietand exercise is a good first step to avoiding the mostKEY TERMS Amnesia Loss of memory often traceable to brain tissue damage Anoxemia An

flatulence and alginic acid which in combination with antacids may help manage GERDgastroesophageal reflux disease Antacids should notbe confused with gastric acid inhibitors such as the Hreceptor blockers cimetidine ranitide and others or theproton pump inhibitors lansoprazole omeprazole andothers Although all three classes of drugs act to reducethe levels of gastric acid their mechanisms are differentand this affects the appropriate use of the drug Antacidshave a rapid onset and short duration of action and aremost appropriate for rapid relief of gastric discomfort fora short period of time Antacids may be divided into two classes those that work by chemical neutralization of gastric acid mostnotably sodium bicarbonate and those that act byadsorption of the acid nonabsorbable antacids such ascalcium and magnesium salts The chemical antacids show the most rapid onset of action but may cause acid rebound a condition inwhich the gastric acid returns in greater concentrationafter the drug effect has stopped Also since theseantacids may contain high concentrations of sodiumthey may be inappropriate in patients with hypertension Calcium and magnesium salts act by adsorption of the acid and are less prone to the rebound effect butmay have other significant disadvantages Theseantacids are particularly prone to drug interactions andpatients taking other medications must often avoidsimultaneous administration of the medications Theseantacids are more effective in liquid formulations thanin tablet or capsule form and so may be inconvenientfor routine dosing The nonabsorbable antacids may have additional uses beyond control of hyperacidity Calcium salts maybe used as diet supplements in prevention of osteoporo sis Aluminum carbonate is useful for binding phosphate and has been effective in treatment and control of hyperphosphatemia or for use with a low phosphate diet to prevent formation of phosphate urinary stones This application is particularly valuable in patients with chronic renalfailure Antacids with aluminum and magnesium hydroxides or aluminum hydroxide alone effectively preventsignificant stress ulcer bleeding in postoperative patients or those with severe burns Recommended dosage The dose depends on the type of antacid Consult specific references When using antacids in chewable tablet form chew the tablet well before swallowing Drink a glass of waterafter taking chewable aluminum hydroxide Lozengesshould be allowed to dissolve completely in the mouth Liquid antacids should be shaken well before using Precautions Antacids should be avoided if any signs of appen dicitis or inflamed bowel are present These include cramping pain and soreness in the lower abdomen bloating and nausea and vomiting Antacids may affect the results of some medical tests such as those that measure how much acid thestomach produces Health care providers and patientsshould keep this in mind when scheduling a medical test Antacids that contain magnesium may cause diar rhea Other types of antacids may cause constipation Avoid taking antacids containing sodium bicarbon ate when the stomach is uncomfortably full from eatingor drinking Antacids should not be given to children under six years of age Antacids that contain calcium or sodium bicarbonate may cause side effects such as dizziness nausea and vomiting in people who consume large amounts of calcium from dairy products or calcium supplements Insome cases this can lead to permanent kidney damageBefore combining antacids with extra calcium checkwith a physician Some antacids contain large amounts of sodium particularly sodium bicarbonate baking soda Anyonewho is on a lowsodium diet should check the list ofingredients or check with a physician or

These tests and exams are essential for protecting the health of a pregnant woman and her developing child Precautions Some tests such as amniocentisis carry a small risk of a miscarriage or other complications that could harm the mother or baby Description Women who become pregnant undergo a wide vari ety of tests throughout the nine months before deliveryIn the early stages physicians order blood tests to screenfor possible disorders or infections such as humanimmunodeficiency virus HIV which can pass from the mother to the fetus Later the focus shifts to checking onfetal wellbeing with a variety of technological toolssuch as ultrasound scans Descriptions of the most common tests and procedures used during pregnancy are listed below When a woman first learns she is pregnant her physician will run a series of routine urine and bloodtests to determine her blood type check for anemia andgestational diabetes make sure she is immune to rubel laGerman measles and check for infectious diseases like HIV hepatitis chlamydia or syphilis Physicians also usually do pelvic exam to screen for cervical can cerand check the patients blood pressure As the preg nancy progresses more tests will follow Ultrasound Ultrasound is a device that records sound waves as they bounce off the developing fetus to create an imagewhich is projected onto a large computer screen Physicians order an ultrasound scan to listen for a fetal heartbeat determine a womans precise due date and check fortwins among other uses An ultrasound scan also is knownas a sonogram The procedure takes a few minutes is painless and usually is covered by health insurance The ultrasound technician will ask the pregnant woman to remove her clothes and change into a gownThe technician may rub some gel on the womans stomach which helps the handheld device pick up sound GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Antenatal testingGEM to A PM Page waves better In certain cases the technician may insert a plastic probe into the womans vaginal canal to get aclearer picture of the fetus Early in pregnancy the testmay need to be done with a full bladder Unlike x rays ultrasound is safe to use during preg nancy It does not cause any known sideeffects thatwould harm the mother or baby Pregnant women usually will have their first ultra sound anytime between and weeks of gestation Innormal cases the technician is able to identify a fetalheartbeat which appears as a flashing light on the screenCloser to the due date physicians use ultrasound to makesure the fetus is in the correct position to exit the birthcanal head first Sometimes an ultrasound will show that a fetus has stopped growing or a gestational sac has formed withouta fetus and a miscarriage has occurred Later in pregnancy it also may show that the child is in a breech positionoriented feet first which can cause a difficult labor Tests for birth defects Most obstetricians offer parents a variety of ways to find out if their developing child might have birth defects such as spina bifida and Down Syndrome An alpha fetoprotein screen can be done through a simpleblood test in the doctors office between the th andth week of gestation It tells the odds that their childwill have a severe congenital anomaly The test works bymeasuring the level of alpha fetoprotein a substance produced by a fetus with birth defects Low levels of alphafetoprotein in the mothers blood may indicate DownsSyndrome In that case the next step for most couples isamniocentesis because the alpha fetoprotein test can give falsepositive results Amniocentesis is a more accurate test but it also has higher risks of complications This procedure typically is used to diagnose Down syndrome while a developing child is still in the wombat weeks During amniocentesis a doctor inserts a needle through a womans vaginal canal and inside her cervixUsing ultrasound as a guide the doctor pierces the uterusto withdraw a sample of fluid from the amniotic sacAfterwards tiny cells shed by the fetus can be studied inthe laboratory Scientists can analyze DNA samples todetermine if the fetus has Down syndrome or othergenetic conditions Amniocentesis also can determine thesex of the fetus Women who have a history of recurring miscar riages may not want to have this procedure Amniocentesis is usually performed in a doctors office on an outpatient basisCommon side effects include cramping and bleeding In about one out of every cases amniocentesis causes a needle to puncture the uterine wall which couldresult in miscarriage In most cases couples find out their baby does not have a birth defect If the results come back positive for Downs Syn drome or other serious conditions the couple mustdecide if they want to end the pregnancy Others use theknowledge to plan and prepare any special care neededfor their future child Group B Strep This test is for Group B streptococci GBS infection By testing for GBS physicians can determine if a woman is at risk of passing this infection along to her child Women who have had a prior child with GBS or who have a fever or prolonged or premature rupture of the amniotic sac may be at higher risk for this type ofinfection GBS is a type of bacteria commonly found in the vagina and rectum Unlike regular strep throat GBS can be present in a persons body without causing anysymptoms so many women do not realize they areinfected with it To test for the presence of GBS doctors may take a urine sample They also may collect samples from thevagina or rectum which are then analyzed in a lab Thistest is usually performed late in pregnancy at weeks of gestation This is a routine urine test or pelvic exam with no side effects In many cases doctors do not find any evidence of this type of infection If a woman is found to be infected with Group B strep physicians usually wait to treat it until just beforelabor begins At that time they may give the motherantibiotics so the baby is not born with the infection Newborns who are exposed to Group B strep can haveinflammation of the brain spinal cord blood or lungsIn some cases this serious complication can result ininfant death

may necessitate further test ing or immediate delivery The results reflect the adequacy of blood flow and oxygen delivery to the fetus fromthe placenta Antepartum tests are usually done in pregnancies at high risk for fetal complications Various reasonsinclude any chronic illness in the mother such as high blood pressure or diabetes problems with previous pregnancies such as stillbirth fetal complications such as intrauterine growth retar dation a slowing of growth of the fetus or birth defects problems in the current pregnancy including pre eclampsia serious pregnancyinduced high blood pressure gestational pregnancyrelated diabetes premature rupture of the membranes excessive amniotic fluidthe liquid that surrounds the fetus vaginal bleedingor placenta previa a condition in which the placenta is positioned over the cervix instead of near the top of theuterus twins or other multiple fetuses One of the most common indications for antepartum testing is postterm pregnancy A pregnancy should notbe allowed to continue past weeks The usual pregnancy is weeks in duration Babies should be monitored with antepartum testing starting at weeks After weeks there is an increasing risk that the placentacannot meet the growing babys needs for oxygen andnutrition This may be reflected in decreased move ments of the baby decreased amniotic fluid and changesin the heart rate pattern of the baby Description Technology The NST and CST use a technique called electronic fetal monitoring to evaluate the heartbeat of the fetus The biophysical profile is an ultrasound examination NST The NST is usually the first antepartum test used to verify fetal wellbeing It is based on the principle thatwhen the fetus moves its heartbeat normally speeds upThe NST assesses fetal health through monitoring accelerations of the heart rate in response to the babys ownmovements ie in the absence of stress The mother lays down or sits and an electronic fetal monitor is placed on her abdomen to monitor the fetalheart rate The doctor records the babys heartbeat on agraph or tracing to determine whether it demonstrates GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Antepartum testingGEM to A PM Page correct reactivity or acceleration of the heart rate To record fetal movements on the tracing the mother presses a button every time she feels the baby move If thebaby is inactive the mother may be asked to rub herabdomen to awaken it Sometimes an instrument isused to produce a loud noise to arouse the fetus vibroacoustic stimulation The test usually takes between minutes A baby who is receiving enough oxygen should move at least twice in a minute period The babysheart rate should increase at least beats per minute forat least seconds during these movements The NST isthe simplest and cheapest antepartum test Biophysical profile The biophysical profile is an ultrasound exam that can add additional information to the NST During thebiophysical profile the examiner checks for variouscharacteristics of the baby to evaluate its overall healthThese include fetal movement fetal tone breathingmovements and the amniotic fluid volume Amnioticfluid volume is important because a decreased amountraises the possibility that the baby may be under stressThe five components of the test NST is also includedare each given a score of for normal or present ifdecreased and for abnormal The highest possiblescore is The modified biophysical profile isanother option this includes only the NST and amnioticfluid volume CST The CST is like the NST except that the fetus is evaluated in response to contractions of the mothersuterus Because it is a more complicated test it is oftenused after an abnormal NST to confirm the results Uterine contractions produce stress in the fetus becausethey temporarily stop the flow of blood and oxygen TheCST is used to confirm that the fetus does not respond tothis stress by a decrease in the heart rate The CST is performed with the same equipment as the NST Maternal blood pressure and fetal heart rate arerecorded along with the onset relative intensity andduration of any spontaneous contractions For an accurate test the contractions should be of sufficient durationand frequency If uterine activity does not occur naturally a drug called oxytocin may be given to the motherintravenously hence the tests alternate name the oxytocin challenge test to provoke contractions Anotheroption is selfstimulation of the mothers nipplesbecause this releases natural oxytocin The fetal heartrate is observed until ideally three moderate contractions occur within minutesPreparation The mother should eat just before the antepartum tests to help stimulate fetal activity Risks There are no appreciable risks from the NST or the biophysical profile Ultrasound used for the biophysicalprofile is painless and safe because it uses no harmfulradiation and no evidence has been found that soundwaves cause any adverse effects on the mother or fetus The frequency of antepartum testing depends on the reason for its use All of the tests occasionally give incorrect results which may prompt an unnecessary earlydelivery or cesarean Repeat testing is important to doublecheck any abnormal findings Normal results In general negative or normal results on antepar tum testing provide reassurance that the baby is healthyand should remain so for perhaps a week with no needfor immediate delivery Unfortunately the tests cannotguarantee that there are no problems because falselynormal results can occur though this is unusual Even ifall test results are normal it is important to realize thatthis does not guarantee a perfect baby The NST is normal reactive if two or more dis tinct fetal movements occur in association with appropriate accelerations of the fetal heart rate within minutesA biophysical profile score of is considered reassuring The CST is normal if the fetus shows no decelerations in heart rate in response to three uterine contractions within minutes Abnormal results A positive result suggests that the baby is not receiving enough oxygen for some reason However it isquite possible that the test result was falsely abnormalTo confirm or monitor a suspected disorder followuptesting with the same or an alternate test will probably beperformed at least weekly The NST is abnormal nonreactive if the fetal heart rate fails to speed up by at least beats per minuteat least two times during a minute period Abnormaldecreases in the heart rate decelerations are also a causefor concern A biophysical profile score of is considered a cause for concern and should be followed by further testing Scores of or less may require immediate deliveryof the fetus GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Antepartum testingGEM to A PM Page Abnormal results on the CST include late decelera tions or abnormal slowing of the fetal heart rate after theuterine contractions This can suggest that the baby is notreceiving enough oxygen and may have difficulty withstanding the stress of labor and vaginal delivery Cesare an section might be necessary so the baby can be spared the stress of labor With either NST or CST a severedeceleration a period of very slow heartbeat can alsosuggest fetal distress The ultimate outcome will depend on the womans individual situation In some cases delivery can be postponed while medication is given to the mother eg forhigh blood pressure or the fetus eg to speed up lungmaturity before delivery Depending upon the readinessof the mothers cervix the doctor may decide to

or lungs In humans the infection can often betreated but it is almost always fatal in animals Description Anthrax is most often found in the agricultural areas of South and Central America southern and eastern Europe Asia Africa the Caribbean and the MiddleEast In the United States anthrax is rarely reportedhowever cases of animal infection with anthrax aremost often reported in Texas Louisiana MississippiOklahoma and South Dakota The bacterium and itsassociated disease get their name from the Greek wordmeaning coal because of the characteristic coalblacksore that is the hallmark of the most common form ofthe disease During the s in England and Germany anthrax was known either as woolsorters or ragpickers disease because workers contracted the disease from bacterial spores present on hides and in wool or fabric fibersSpores are the small thickwalled dormant stage of somebacteria that enable them to survive for long periods oftime under adverse conditions The first anthrax vaccinewas perfected in by Louis Pasteur GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AnthraxGEM to A PM Page The largest outbreak ever recorded in the United States occurred in when nine employees of a goathair processing plant became ill after handling a contaminated shipment from Pakistan Four of the five patientswith the pulmonary form of the disease died Other casesappeared in the s when contaminated goatskindrumheads from Haiti were brought into this country assouvenirs Today anthrax is rare even among cattlelargely because of widespread animal vaccination How ever some serious epidemics continue to occur amonganimal herds and in human settlements in developingcountries due to ineffective control programs There has been a great deal of recent concern that the bacteria that causes anthrax may be used by somecountries as a type of biological warfare since it is possible to become infected simply by breathing in the sporesThe largestever documented outbreak of human anthraxcontracted through spore inhalation occurred in Russia in when anthrax spores were released from a militarylaboratory causing a regional epidemic that killed ofits victims Because the United States governmentconsiders anthrax to be of potential risk to soldiers theDepartment of Defense has begun systematic vaccinationof all military personnel against anthrax and othernations such as Britain are rapidly following suit Causes and symptoms Anthrax is caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis which produces spores that can remain dor mant for years in soil and on animal products such ashides wool hair or bones The disease is often fatal tocattle sheep and goats and their hides wool and bonesare often heavily contaminated Today in humans the disease is almost always an occupational hazard contracted by those who handleanimal hides farmers butchers and veterinarians or sort wool It is also possible to become infected withanthrax by eating meat from contaminated animalsThere are no reports of the disease spreading from oneperson to another Symptoms vary depending on how the disease was contracted but the symptoms usually appear within oneweek of exposure Cutaneous anthrax In humans anthrax usually occurs when the bacteria enter a cut or abrasion causing a skin cutaneous infection at the site Cutaneous anthrax as this infection iscalled is the mildest form of the disease At first thebacteria cause an itchy raised area like an insect biteWithin one to two days inflammation occurs around theraised area and a blister forms around an area of dyingtissue that becomes black in the center Other symptomsmay include shivering and chills In most cases the bacteria remain within the sore If however they spread to thenearest lymph node or in rare cases escape into thebloodstream the bacteria can cause a form of blood poi soning that rapidly proves fatal Inhalation anthrax Inhaling the bacteria or bacterial spores can lead to a rare fatal form of anthrax known as pulmonary orinhalation anthrax that attacks the lungs and sometimesspreads to the brain Inhalation anthrax begins with flulike symptoms namely fever fatigue headache and shortness of breath but progresses to bronchitis dur ing which time it becomes difficult to breathe and finally the patient enters a state of shock This rare form of anthrax is usually fatal even if treated within one or twodays after the symptoms appear Intestinal anthrax Intestinal anthrax is a rare oftenfatal form of the dis ease caused by eating meat from an animal that died ofanthrax Intestinal anthrax causes stomach and intestinalinflammation and sores or lesions ulcers much like thesores that appear on the skin in the cutaneous form ofanthrax The first signs of the disease are nausea and vomiting loss of appetite and fever followed by abdomi nal pain vomiting of blood and severe bloody diarrhea Diagnosis Anthrax is diagnosed by detecting B anthracis in samples taken from blood skin lesions or respiratory secretions The bacteria may be positively identifiedusing biochemical methods or using a technique where GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Anthrax Humans suffering from anthrax often develop ulcerating nodules on the body Custom

curable by administering high doses of penicillin but in the advanced stages it canbe fatal Other commonly used antibiotics such as ery thromycin tetracycline or chloramphenicol are also effective particularly for those individuals who are allergic topenicillin Although not proven it is thought that newerantibiotics like ciprofloxacin and some cephalosporins may also prove effective Although cutaneous anthrax maybe cured following a single dose of antibiotic it is important to continue treatment so as to avoid potential seriouscomplications such as inflammation of the membranescovering the brain and spinal cord meningitis Prognosis Untreated anthrax is often fatal but death is far less likely with appropriate care Ten to twenty percent ofpatients will die from anthrax of the skin cutaneousanthrax if it is not properly treated All patients withinhalation pulmonary anthrax will die if untreatedIntestinal anthrax is fatal of the time Prevention Anthrax is relatively rare in the United States because of widespread animal vaccination and practicesused to disinfect hides or other animal products Forthose in highrisk professions an anthrax vaccine isavailable that is effective in protecting against infection To provide this immunity an individual must begiven an initial course of three injections given twoweeks apart followed by booster injections at and months and an annual immunization thereafter Approximately of those who have been vacci nated against anthrax may notice mild local reactionssuch as a slight tenderness at the injection site Someonewho has already had anthrax might have a more severelocal reaction upon vaccination Infrequently there maybe a severe local reaction with extensive swelling of theforearm and only a very few vaccine recipients

whiteheads and more severe forms ofacne Purpose Different types of antiacne drugs are used for differ ent purposes For example lotions soaps gels andcreams containing benzoyl peroxide or tretinoin may beused to clear up mild to moderately severe acneIsotretinoin Accutane is prescribed only for verysevere disfiguring acne Acne is a skin condition that occurs when pores or hair follicles become blocked This allows a waxymaterial sebum to collect inside the pores or folliclesNormally sebum flows out onto the skin and hair toform a protective coating but when it cannot get outsmall swellings develop on the skin surface Bacteriaand dead skin cells can also collect that can causeinflammation Swellings that are small and notinflamed are whiteheads or blackheads When theybecome inflamed they turn into pimples Pimples thatfill with pus are called pustules Acne cannot be cured but acne drugs can help clear the skin Benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin work by mildlyirritating the skin This encourages skin cells to sloughoff which helps open blocked pores Benzoyl peroxidealso kills bacteria which helps prevent whiteheads andblackheads from turning into pimples Isotretinoinshrinks the glands that produce sebumDescription Benzoyl peroxide is found in many overthecounter acne products that are applied to the skin such asBenoxyl Clear By Design Neutrogena Acne PanOxyland some formulations of Clean Clear Clearasil andOxy Some benzoyl peroxide products are available without a physicians prescription others require a prescription Tretinoin RetinA is available only with a

episodes of social phobia and specific phobiaClinically significant anxiety is marked by severalKEY TERMS Angina pectoris A feeling of tightness heavi ness or pain in the chest caused by a lack of oxygen in the muscular wall of the heartsymptoms The patient experiences marked or persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations inwhich he or she is exposed to unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others and may react in a humiliatingor embarrassing way The exposure to the feared situation produces an anxiety attack Fear of these episodesof anxiety leads to avoidance behavior which impairsnormal social functioning including working or attending classes The patient is aware that these fears areunjustified Description In psychiatric practice treatment of anxiety has largely turned from traditional antianxiety agents anxiolytics to antidepressant therapies In current use thebenzodiazepines the best known class of anxiolytics have been largely supplanted by serotoninspecific reuptake inhibitors SSRIs citalopram fluoxetine fluvoxamine and others which have a milder side effect profileand less risk of dependency However traditional anxiolytics remain useful for patients who need a rapid onsetof action or whose frequency of exposure to anxiety provoking stimuli is low enough to eliminate the need forcontinued treatment While SSRIs may require three tofive weeks to show any effects and must be taken continuously benzodiazepines may produce a response within minutes and may be dosed on an asneeded basis The intermediate action benzodiazepines alprazo lam Xanax and lorazepam Ativan are the appropriatechoice for treatment of mild anxiety and social phobiaDiazepam Valium is still widely used for anxiety butits active metabolite desmethyldiazepam which has along halflife may make this a poorer choice than otherdrugs in its class Note that there is considerable variation between individuals in metabolism of benzodiazepines so patient response may not be predictable Asa class benzodiazepines are used not only as anxiolyticsbut also as sedatives muscle relaxants and in treatment of epilepsy and alcoholism The distinctions

is also atraditional anxiolytic although it is now consideredeither a third line or adjunctive agent for use after trialsof SSRIs and benzodiazepines It is appropriate for use inpatients who have either failed trials of other treatmentsor who should not receive benzodiazepines because of ahistory of substance abuse problems Buspirone in common with antidepressants requires a two to three

Antiasthmatic drugs Definition Antiasthmatic drugs are medicines that treat or pre vent asthma attacks Purpose For people with asthma the simple act of breathing can be a struggle Their airways become inflamed andblocked with mucus during asthma attacks narrowing theopening through which air passes This is not such a problem when the person breathes in because the airways naturally expand when a person takes a breath The real problem arises when the person with asthma tries to breatheout The air cannot get out through the blocked airways soit stays trapped in the lungs With each new breath theperson can take in only a little more air so breathingbecomes shallow and takes more and more effort Asthma attacks can be caused by allergies to pollen dust pets or other things but people without knownallergies may also have asthma Exercise stress intense emotions exposure to cold certain medicines and somemedical conditions also can bring on attacks The two main approaches to dealing with asthma are avoiding substances and situations that trigger attacksand using medicines that treat or prevent the symptomsWith a combination of the two most people with asthmacan find relief and live normal lives Description Three types of drugs are used in treating and pre venting asthma attacks GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Antiasthmatic drugsGEM to A PM Page Bronchodilators relax the smooth muscles that line the airway This makes the airways open wider lettingmore air pass through them These drugs are used mainly to relieve sudden asthma attacks or to prevent attacksthat might come on after exercise They may be takenby mouth injected or inhaled Corticosteroids block the inflammation that narrows the airways Used regularly these drugs will help prevent asthma attacks Those attacks that do occur will beless severe However corticosteroids cannot stop anattack that is already underway These drugs may betaken by mouth injected or inhaled Cromolyn also is taken regularly to prevent asthma attacks and may be used alone or with other asthmamedicines It cannot stop an attack that already hasstarted The drug works by preventing certain cells inthe body from releasing substances that cause allergicreactions or asthma symptoms One brand of thisdrug Nasalcrom comes in capsule and nasal sprayforms and is used to treat hay fever and other aller gies The inhalation form of the drug Intal is used forasthma It comes in aerosol canisters in capsules thatare inserted into an inhaler and in liquid form that isused in a nebulizer Precautions Using antiasthmatic drugs properly is important Because bronchodilators provide quick relief some people may be tempted to overuse them However withsome kinds of bronchodilators this can lead to seriousand possibly lifethreatening complications In the longrun patients are better off using bronchodilators only asdirected and also using corticosteroids which eventually will reduce their need for bronchodilators Patients who are using their antiasthmatic drugs cor rectly but feel their asthma is not under control shouldsee their physicians The physician can either increasethe dose switch to another medicine or add another medicine to the regimen Corticosteroids are powerful drugs that may cause serious side effects when used over a long time Howeverthese problems are much less likely with the inhalantforms than with the oral and injected forms While theoral and injected forms generally should be used only forone to two weeks the inhalant forms may be used forlong periods When used to prevent asthma attacks cromolyn must be taken as directed every day The drug may takeas long as four weeks to start working Unless told to doso by a physician patients should not stop taking thedrug just because it does not seem to be working Whensymptoms do begin to improve patients should continuetaking all medicines that have been prescribed unless aphysician directs otherwise Side effects Inhalant forms of

and is caused by toxins produced by the bacterium Clostridium difficile Description Antibioticassociated colitis also called antibiotic associated enterocolitis can occur following antibiotictreatment The bacteria Clostridia difficile are normally found in the intestines of of healthy adults but people can also pick up the bacteria while they are in a hospital or nursing home In a healthy person harmless resident intestinal bacteria compete with each other for foodand places to sit along the inner intestinal wall Whenantibiotics are given most of the resident bacteria areKEY TERMS Asthma A

be inhaledkilled With fewer bacteria to compete with the normally harmless Clostridia difficile grow rapidly and produce toxins These toxins damage the inner wall of theintestines and cause inflammation and diarrhea Although all antibiotics can cause this disease it is most commonly caused by clindamycin Cleocin ampicillin Omnipen amoxicillin Amoxil Augmentin orWymox and any in the cephalosporin class such ascefazolin or cephalexin Symptoms of the condition canoccur during antibiotic treatment or within four weeksafter the treatment has stopped In approximately half of cases of antibioticassociated colitis the condition progresses to a more severe form ofcolitis called pseudomembranous enterocolitis in whichpseudomembranes are excreted in the stools Pseudomembranes are membranelike collections of white blood cellsmucus and the protein that causes blood to clot fibrinthat are released by the damaged intestinal wall Causes and symptoms Antibioticassociated colitis is caused by toxins pro duced by the bacterium Clostridium difficile after treat ment with antibiotics When most of the other intestinalbacteria have been killed Clostridium difficile grows rapidly and releases toxins that damage the intestinalwall The disease and symptoms are caused by these toxins not by the bacterium itself Symptoms of antibioticassociated colitis usually begin four to ten days after antibiotic treatment hasbegun The early signs and symptoms of this diseaseinclude lower abdominal cramps an increased need topass stool and watery diarrhea As the disease progresses the patient may experience a general ill feelingfatigue abdominal pain and fever If the disease pro ceeds to pseudomembranous enterocolitis the patientmay also experience nausea vomiting large amounts ofwatery diarrhea and a very high fever FC Complications of antibioticassociated colitisinclude severe dehydration imbalances in blood miner als low blood pressure fluid accumulation in deep skin edema

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Antibioticassociated colitisGEM to A PM Page individuals with poor hygiene individuals who have been hospitalized for a long peri od of time The Clostridium difficile toxin is found in the stools of persons older than years of age times morefrequently than in the stools of persons who are years old As a result the elderly are much more prone todeveloping antibioticassociated colitis than youngerindividuals Diagnosis Antibioticassociated colitis can be diagnosed by the symptoms and recent medical history of the patient by alaboratory test for the bacterial toxin andor by using aprocedure called endoscopy If the diarrhea and related symptoms occurred after the patient received antibiotics antibioticassociated colitis may be suspected A stool sample may be analyzedfor the presence of the Clostridium difficile toxin This toxin test is the preferred diagnostic test for antibioticassociated colitis One frequently used test for the toxininvolves adding the processed stool sample to a humancell culture If the toxin is present in the stool sample thecells die It may take up to two days to get the resultsfrom this test A simpler test which provides results intwo to three hours is also available Symptoms and toxintest results are usually enough to diagnose the disease Another tool that may be useful in the diagnosis of antibioticassociated colitis however is a procedurecalled an endoscopy that involves inserting a thin lightedtube into the rectum to visually inspect the intestinal lining Two different types of endoscopy procedures thesigmoidoscopy and the colonoscopy are used to view different parts of the large intestine These proceduresare performed in a hospital or doctors office Patients aresedated during the procedure to make them more comfortable and are allowed to go home after recoveringfrom the sedation Treatment Diarrhea regardless of the cause is always treated by encouraging the individual to replace lost fluids andprevent dehydration One method to treat antibioticassociated colitis is to simply stop taking the antibiotic thatcaused the disease This allows the normal intestinal bacteria to repopulate the intestines and inhibits the overgrowth of Clostridium difficile Many patients with mild disease respond well to this and are free from diarrheawithin two weeks It

derived from bacterialsources and are used to treat bacterial infections Otherclasses of drugs most notably the sulfonamides may be effective antibacterials Similarly some antibiotics mayhave secondary uses such as the use of demeclocyclineDeclomycin a tetracycline derivative to treat the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone SIADHsecretion Other antibiotics may be useful in treating protozoal infections Purpose Antibiotics are used for treatment or prevention of bacterial infection Description Classifications Although there are several classification schemes for antibiotics based on bacterial spectrum broad versus narrow or route of administration injectable versus oral versus topical or type of activity bactericidal vs bacteriostatic the most useful is based on chemical structure Antibiotics within a structural class will generally show similarpatterns of effectiveness toxicity and allergic potential PENICILLINS The penicillins are the oldest class of antibiotics and have a common chemical structure whichthey share with the cephalopsorins The two groups areclassed as the betalactam antibiotics and are generallybacteriocidalthat is they kill bacteria rather thaninhibiting growth The penicillins can be further subdivided The natural pencillins are based on the originalpenicillin G structure penicillinaseresistant penicillinsnotably methicillin and oxacillin are active even in thepresence of the bacterial enzyme that inactivates mostnatural penicillins Aminopenicillins such as ampicillinand amoxicillin have an extended spectrum of actioncompared with the natural penicillins extended spectrum GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AntibioticsGEM to A PM Page penicillins are effective against a wider range of bacteria These generally include coverage for Pseudomonas aeruginaosa and may provide the penicillin in combina tion with a penicillinase inhibitor CEPHALOSPORINS Cephalosporins and the closely related cephamycins and carbapenems like the pencillins contain a betalactam chemical structure Consequently there are patterns of crossresistance and crossallergenicity among the drugs in these classes Thecepha drugs are among the most diverse classes ofantibiotics and are themselves subgrouped into st ndand rd generations Each generation has a broader spectrum of activity than the one before In addition cefoxitin a cephamycin is highly active against anaerobicbacteria which offers utility in treatment of abdominalinfections The rd generation drugs cefotaxime ceftizoxime ceftriaxone and others cross the bloodbrainbarrier and may be used to treat meningitis and encephalitis Cephalopsorins are the usually preferred agents for surgical prophylaxis FLUROQUINOLONES The fluroquinolones are syn thetic antibacterial agents and not derived from bacteriaThey are included here because they can be readily interchanged with traditional antibiotics An earlier relatedclass of antibacterial agents the quinolones were notwell absorbed and could be used only to treat urinarytract infections The fluroquinolones which are based onthe older group are broadspectrum bacteriocidal drugsthat are chemically unrelated to the penicillins or thecephaloprosins They are well distributed into bone tissue and so well absorbed that in general they are aseffective by the oral route as by intravenous infusion TETRACYCLINES Tetracyclines got their name because they share a chemical structure that has fourrings They are derived from a species of Streptomyces bacteria Broadspectrum bacteriostatic agents thetetracyclines may be effective against a wide varietyof microorganisms including rickettsia and amebicparasites MACROLIDES The macrolide antibiotics are derived from Streptomyces bacteria and got their name because they all have a macrocyclic lactone chemical structureErythromycin the prototype of this class has a spectrumand use similar to penicillin Newer members of thegroup azithromycin and clarithyromycin are particularly useful for their high level of lung penetration Clarithromycin has been widely used to treat Helicobacter pylori infections the cause of stomach ulcers OTHERS Other classes of antibiotics include the aminoglycosides which are particularly useful for their effectiveness in treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections the lincosamindes clindamycin and lincomycin which are highly active against anaerobic pathogensThere are other individual drugs which may have utilityin specific infections Recommended dosage Dosage varies with drug route of administration

thick spreadable substance that contains medicine and is meant to be used on theskin or if it is specifically an ophthalmic or eyeointment in the eyePurpose Topical antibiotics help prevent infections caused by bacteria that get into minor cuts scrapes and burns Treating minor wounds with antibiotics allows quicker healing If the wounds are left untreated the bacteria willmultiply causing pain redness swelling itching and oozing Untreated infections can eventually spread andbecome much more serious Different kinds of topical antibiotics kill different kinds of bacteria Many antibiotic firstaid products contain combinations of antibiotics to make them effectiveagainst a broad range of bacteria When treating a wound it is not enough to simply apply a topical antibiotic The wound must first be cleanedwith soap and water and patted dry After the antibiotic isapplied the wound should be covered with a dressingsuch as a bandage or a protective gel or spray For manyyears it was thought that wounds heal best when exposedto the air But now most experts say it is best to keepwounds clean and moist while they heal The coveringshould still allow some air to reach the wound however Description Some topical antibiotics are available without a pre scription and are sold in many forms including creamsointments powders and sprays Some widely used topical antibiotics are bacitracin

be applied within four hours after injury Do not use more than therecommended amount and do not apply it more oftenthan three times a day Do not apply the medicine overlarge areas of skin or on open wounds Precautions Many public health experts are concerned about antibiotic resistance a problem that can develop whenantibiotics are overused Over time bacteria develop newdefenses against antibiotics that once were effectiveagainst them Because bacteria reproduce so quicklythese defenses can be rapidly passed on through generations of bacteria until almost all are immune to the GALE

advise people to usetopical antibiotics only for short periods that is until thewound heals and only as directed For the topical antibiotic to work best it should be used only to prevent infection in a fresh wound not to treat an infection that hasalready started Wounds that are not fresh may need theattention of a physician to prevent complications such asblood poisoning Topical antibiotics are meant to be used only on the skin and only for only a few days at a time If the woundhas not healed in five days stop using the antibiotic andcall a doctor Do not use topical antibiotics on large

but others cells that commonly reproduce quickly including hair follicles ovariesand testis and the bloodforming organs Newer approaches to antineoplastic drug therapy have taken different approaches including angigenesisthe inhibition of formation of blood vessels feeding thetumor and contributing to tumor growth Although theseapproaches hold promise they are not yet in common use Antineoplastic drugs may be divided into two class es cycle specific and noncycle specific Cycle specificdrugs act only at specific points of the cells duplicationcycle such as anaphase or metaphase while noncyclespecific drugs may act at any point in the cell cycle Inorder to gain maximum effect antineoplastic drugs arecommonly used in combinations Precautions Because antineoplastic agents do not target specific cell types they have a number of common adverse sideeffects Hair loss is common due to the effects on hair follicles and anemia immune system impairment and clotting problems are caused by destruction of the blood forming organs leading to reduction in the number of red cellswhite cells and platelets Because of the frequency andseverity of these side effects it is common to administerchemotherapy in cycles allowing time for recovery from the drug effects before administering the next dose Dosesare often calculated not on the basis of weight but ratherbased on blood

including dose scheduling and avoidance of drugdrug and fooddrug interactions Appropriate steps should be taken to minimize side effects These may include administration of antinauseant medications to reduce nausea and vomiting maintaining fluid levels to reduce drug toxicity particularly tothe kidneys or application of a scalp tourniquet to reduceblood flow to the scalp and minimize hair loss due todrug therapy Patients receiving chemotherapy are also at risk of infections due to reduced white blood counts While prophylactic antibiotics may be useful the health care pro fessional should also

drugs used to prevent clot forma tion or to prevent a clot that has formed from enlargingThey inhibit clot formation by blocking the action ofclotting factors or platelets Anticoagulant drugs fall intothree categories inhibitors of clotting factor synthesisinhibitors of thrombin and antiplatelet drugs Purpose Anticoagulant drugs reduce the ability of the blood to form clots Although blood clotting is essential to prevent serious bleeding in the case of skin cuts clots insidethe blood vessels block the flow of blood to major organsand cause heart attacks and strokes Although these drugsare sometimes called blood thinners they do not actuallythin the blood Furthermore this type of medication willnot dissolve clots that already have formed although thedrug stops an existing clot from worsening Howeveranother type of drug used in thrombolytic therapy will dissolve existing clots Anticoagulant drugs are used for a number of condi tions For example they may be given to prevent bloodclots from forming after the replacement of a heart valveor to reduce the risk of a stroke or another heart attack after a first heart attack They are also used to reduce thechance of blood clots forming during open heart surgeryor bypass surgery Low doses of these drugs may begiven to prevent blood clots in patients who must stay inbed for a long time after certain types of surgery Because anticoagulants affect the bloods ability to clot they can increase the risk of severe bleeding andheavy blood loss It is thus essential to take these drugsexactly as directed and to see a physician regularly aslong as they are prescribed Description Anticoagulant drugs also called anticlotting drugs or blood thinners are available only with a physiciansprescription They come in tablet and injectable formsThey fall into three groups Inhibitors of clotting factor synthesis These anticoagu lants inhibit the production of certain clotting factors inthe liver One example is warfarin brand namecoumadin Inhibitors of thrombin Thrombin inhibitors interfere with blood clotting by blocking the activity of thrombin They include heparin lepirudin Refludan Antiplatelet drugs Antiplatelet drugs interact with platelets which is a type of blood cell to blockplatelets from aggregating into harmful clots Theyinclude aspirin ticlopidine Ticlid clopidogrel Plav ix tirofiban Aggrastat and eptifibatide Integrilin Recommended dosage The recommended dosage depends on the type of anticoagulant drug and the medical condition for which itis prescribed The prescribing physician or the pharmacistwho filled the prescription can provide information concerning the correct dosage Usually the physician willadjust the dose after checking the patients clotting time Anticoagulant drugs must be taken exactly as direct ed by the physician Larger or more frequent dosesshould not be taken and the drug should also not betaken for longer than prescribed Taking too much of this medication can cause severe bleeding Anticoagulants should also be taken on schedule A record of each doseshould be kept as it is taken If a dose is missed it shouldbe taken as soon as possible followed by the regular doseschedule However a patient who forgets to take amissed dose until the next day should not take the misseddose at all and should not double the next dose as thiscould lead to bleeding A record of all missed dosesshould be kept for the prescribing physician who shouldbe informed at the scheduled visits Precautions Persons who take anticoagulants should see a physi cian regularly while taking these drugs particularly atthe beginning of therapy The physician will order periodic blood tests to check the bloods clotting ability Theresults of these tests will help the physician determinethe proper amount of medication to be taken each day Time is required for normal clotting ability to return after anticoagulant treatment During this period patientsmust observe the same precautions they observed whiletaking the drug The length of time needed for the bloodto return to normal depends on the type of anticoagulantdrug that was taken The prescribing physician will adviseas to how long the precautions should be observed People who are taking anticoagulant drugs should tell all physicians dentists pharmacists and other medical professionals who provide medical treatments or services to them that they are taking such a medication GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugsGEM to A PM Page They should also carry identification stating that they are using an anticoagulant drug Other prescription drugs or overthecounter medi cineespecially aspirinshould be not be taken withoutthe prescribing physician being informed Because of the risk of heavy bleeding anyone who takes an anticoagulant drug must take care to avoidinjuries Sports and other potentially hazardous activitiesshould be avoided Any falls blows to the body or heador other injuries should be reported to a physician asinternal bleeding may occur without any obvious symptoms Special care should be taken in shaving and inbrushing and flossing the teeth Soft

MEDICINE Anticonvulsant drugsGEM to A PM Page Purpose Anticonvulsant drugs are used to control seizures in people with epilepsy Epilepsy is not a single diseaseitis a set of symptoms that may have different causes indifferent people The common thread is an imbalance inthe brains electrical activity This imbalance causesseizures that may affect part or all of the body and mayor may not cause a loss of consciousness Anticonvulsantdrugs act on the brain to reduce the frequency and severity of seizures Some cases of epilepsy are brought on by head injuries brain tumors or infections or metabolic problems such as low blood sugar But in some people withepilepsy the cause is not clear Anticonvulsant drugs are an important part of the treatment program for epilepsy Different kinds of drugsmay be prescribed for different types of seizures In addition to taking medicine patients with epilepsy should getenough rest avoid stress and practice good health habits Some physicians believe that giving the drugs to children with epilepsy may prevent the condition fromgetting worse in later life However others say the effectsare the same whether treatment is started early or later inlife

Antidepressant drugs Definition Antidepressant drugs are medicines that relieve symptoms of depressive disorders Purpose Depressive disorders may be either unipolar depres sion alone or bipolar depression alternating with periods of extreme excitation The formal diagnosis requiresa cluster of symptoms lasting at least two weeks Thesesymptoms include but are not limited to mood changesinsomnia or hypersomnia and diminished interest in daily activities The symptoms are not caused by anymedical condition drug side effect or adverse life eventThe condition is severe enough to cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social occupational orother important areas of functioningSecondary depression depression caused by unfa vorable life events is normally self limiting and may bebest treated with cognitivebehavioral therapy rather thandrugs Description Antidepressant agents act by increasing the levels of excitatory neurostransmitters The main types of antidepressant drugs in use today are tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline Elavil imipramine Tofranil nortriptyline Pamelor selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs or serotonin boosters such as fluoxetine Prozac paroxetine Paxil and sertraline Zoloft monoamine oxidase inhibitors MAO inhibitors such as phenelzine Nardil and tranylcypromine Parnate tetracyclic compounds and atypical antidepressants which do not fall into any of the above categories Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors maintain lev els of the excitatory neurohormone serotonin in thebrain They do not alter levels of norepinephrine Thesehave become the drugs of choice for a variety of psychiatric disorders primarily because of their low incidenceof severe side effects as compared with other drugs inthis therapeutic class SSRIs show similar actions andside effect profiles but may vary in duration of action Tricyclic compounds identified by their chemical structure containing three carbon rings are an older classof antidepressants Although generally effective theyhave a high incidence of anticholinergic effects notablydry mouth and dry eyes which can cause discomfort They also cause cardiac arrythmias Because tricyclicsact on both serotonin and norepinephrine they may havesome value in treatment of patients who fail to respond toSSRIs Drugs in this class are often available at lowprices which may be significant when cost is a majorfactor in treatment They have also been found useful incontrol of some neurologic pain syndromes Tricyclic antidepressants are similar but may vary in severity of side effects most notably the degree of seda tion and the extent of the anticholinergic effects Tetracyclic compounds and atypical antidepressants are chemically distinct from both the major groups andeach other Although maprotilene no brand name marketed in generic form only and mirtazepine Remeronare similar in chemical structures they differ in their balance of activity on serotonine and norepinephrine levels Monoamine oxidase inhibitors phenelzine Nardil tranylcypromine Parnate have largely been supplanted GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Antidepressant drugsGEM to A PM Page in therapy because of their high risk of severe adverse effects most notably severe hypertension They act by inhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase which isresponsible for the metabolism of the stimulatory neurohormones norepinephrine epinephrine dopamine andserotonin The MAOIs are normally reserved for patientswho are resistant to safer drugs Two drugs eldeprylCarbex used in treatment of Parkinsons disease and the herb St Johns wort have some action against monoamine oxidase B and have shown some value asantidepressants They do not share the same risks as thenonselective MAO inhibitors All antidepressant agents regardless of their struc ture have a slow onset of action typically three to fiveweeks Although adverse effects may be seen as early asthe first dose significant therapeutic improvement isalways delayed Similarly the effects of antidepressantswill continue for a similar length of time after the drugshave been discontinued Recommended dosage Dose varies with the specific drug and patient Con sult specialized references Precautions Antidepressants have many significant cautions and adverse effects Although a few are listed here specificreferences should be consulted for more complete information SSRIs The most common side effect of SSRIs is exci tation and insomnia Excitation has been reported in over of patients and insomnia in Significant weightloss has been frequently reported but most commonly inpatients who are already underweight SSRIs may causesome sedation and patients should be cautioned not to perform tasks requiring alertness until they have evaluated the effects of these drugs SSRIs are pregnancy category C drugs Most SSRIs are excreted in breast milk and therehave been anecdotal reports of somnolence in infantswhose mothers were taking SSRIs while breastfeeding Tricyclic antidepressants Amoxepine not marketed by brand generic available although a tricyclic antidepressant rather than a neuroleptic major tranquilizerdisplays some of the more serious effects of the neuroleptics including tardive dyskinesias drug inducedinvoluntary movements and neuroleptic malignant syndrome a potentially fatal syndrome whose symptomsinclude high fever altered mental status irregular pulse or blood pressure and changes in heart rate Theseadverse effects have not been reported with other tricyclic antidepressants The most common adverse effects of tricyclic antide pressants are sedation and the anticholinergic effectssuch as dry mouth dry eyes and difficult urination Alterations in heartbeat are also common and may progress tocongestive heart failure stroke and sudden death Tricyclic antidepressants are in pregnancy categories C or D although there have been no formal studies of thedrugs on fetal development There are no studies ofeffects on newborns but some anecdotal reports of malformations have resulted from animal studies The drugsare excreted in breast milk Monoamine oxidase inhibitors The greatest risk associated with these drugs is a hypertensive crisis whichmay be fatal and most often occurs when the drugs aretaken with interacting foods or drugs More commonadverse reactions may include low

resistance Treatment of type I diabetes is limited to insulin replacement while type II diabetes is treatable by a number of therapeutic approaches Many cases of insulinresistance are asymptomatic due to normal increases ininsulin secretion and others may be controlled by dietand exercise Drug therapy may be directed towards increasing insulin secretion increasing insulin sensitivity or increasing insulin penetration of the cells Description Antidiabetic drugs may be subdivided into six groups insulin sufonylureas alphaglucosidase inhibitorsbiguanides meglitinides and thiazolidinediones Insulin Humulin Novolin is the hormone responsi ble for glucose utilization It is effective in both types ofdiabetes since even in insulin resistance some sensitivity remains and the condition can be treated with largerdoses of insulin Most insulins are now produced byrecombinant DNA techniques and are chemically identical to natural human insulin Isophane insulin suspension insulin zinc suspension and other formulations areintended to extend the duration of action of insulin andpermit glucose control over longer periods of time Sulfonylureas chlorpropamide Diabinese tolaza mide Tolinase glipizide Glucotrol and others act byincreasing insulin release from the beta cells of the pancrease Glimepiride Amaryl a member of this classappears to have a useful secondary action in increasinginsulin sensitivity in peripheral cells Alphaglucosidase inhibitors acarbose Precose miglitol Glyset do not enhance insulin secretionRather they inhibit the conversion of disaccharides andcomplex carbohydrates to glucose This mechanism doesnot prevent conversion but only delays it reducing thepeak blood glucose levels Alphaglucosidase inhibitorsare useful for either monotherapy or in combination therapy with sulfonylureas or other hypoglycemic agents Metformin Glucophage is the only available mem ber of the biguanide class Metformin decreases hepaticglucose production decreases intestinal absorption ofglucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization Metformin may be used as monotherapy or incombination therapy with a sulfonylurea There are two members of the meglitinide class repaglinide Prandin and nateglitinide Starlix Themechanism of action of the meglitinides is to stimulateinsulin production This activity is both dose dependentand dependent on the presence of glucose so that thedrugs have reduced effectiveness in the presence of low blood glucose levels The meglitinides may be used aloneor in combination with metformin The manufacturerwarns that nateglitinide should not be used in combination with other drugs which enhance insulin secretion Rosiglitazone Avandia and pioglitazone Actos and the members of the thiazolidinedione class They actby both reducing glucose production in the liver andincreasing insulin dependent glucose uptake in musclecells They do not increase insulin production Thesedrugs may be used in combination with metoformin or asulfonylurea Recommended dosage Dosage must be highly individualized for all antidia betic agents and is based on blood glucose levels whichmust be taken regularly Review specific literature Precautions Insulin The greatest short term risk of insulin is hypoglycemia which may be the result of either a direct overdose or an imbalance between insulin injection andlevel of exercise and diet This may also occur in thepresence of other conditions which reduce the glucoseload such as illness with vomiting and diarrhea Treat ment is with glucose in the form of glucose tablets or liquid although severe cases may require intravenous therapy Allergic reactions and skin reactions may also occurInsulin is classified as category B in pregnancy and is considered the drug of choice for glucose control duringpregnancy Insulin glargine Lantus an insulin analogwhich is suitable for oncedaily dosing is classified ascategory C because there have been reported changes inthe hearts of newborns in animal studies of this drug Thereports are essentially anecdotal and no cause and effectrelationship has been determined Insulin is not recommended during breast feeding because either low of highdoses of insulin may inhibit milk production Insulinadministered orally is destroyed in the GI tract and represents no risk to the newborn Sulonylureas All sulfonylurea drugs may cause hypoglycemia Most patients become resistant to thesedrugs over time and may require either dose adjustmentsor a switch to insulin The list of adverse reactions isextensive and includes central nervous system problemsand skin reactions among others Hematologic reactionsalthough rare may be severe and include aplastic ane mia and hemolytic anemia The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been associated with increasedcardiovascular mortality as compared with treatmentwith diet alone or diet plus insulin The sulfonylureas areclassified as category C during pregnancy based on ani GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Antidiabetic drugsGEM to A PM Page mal studies although glyburide has not shown any harm to the fetus and is classified as category B Because theremay be significant alterations in blood glucose levelsduring pregnancy it is recommended that patients beswitch to insulin These drugs have not been fully studiedduring breast feeding but it is recommended thatbecause their presence in breast milk might cause hypoglycemia in the newborn breastfeeding be avoided whiletaking sulfonylureas Alphaglucosidase inhibitors are generally well tol erated and do not cause hypoglycemia The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal problemsincluding flatulence diarrhea and abdominal pain These drugs are classified as category B in pregnancyAlthough there is no evidence that the drugs are harmfulto the fetus it is important that rigid blood glucose control be maintained during pregnancy and pregnantwomen should be switched to insulin Alphaglucosidaseinhibitors may be excreted in small amounts in breastmilk and it is recommended that the drugs not be administered to nursing mothers Metformin causes gastrointestinal reactions in about a third of patients A rare but very serious reaction tometformin is lactic acidosis which is fatal in about of cases Lactic acidosis occurs in patients with multiplemedical problems including renal insufficiency The riskmay be reduced with careful renal monitoring and careful dose adjustments to metformin Metformin is category B during pregnancy There have been no carefullycontrolled studies of the drug during pregnancy but thereis no evidence of fetal harm from animal studies It isimportant that rigid blood glucose control be maintainedduring pregnancy and pregnant women should beswitched to insulin Animal studies show that metforminis excreted in milk It is recommended that metforminnot be administered to nursing mothers Meglitinides These drugs are generally well tolerat ed with an adverse event profile similar to placebo Thedrugs are classified as category C during pregnancybased on fetal abnormalities in rabbits given about times the normal human dose It is important that rigidblood glucose control be maintained during pregnancy and pregnant women should be switched to insulin It isnot known whether the meglitinides are excreted inhuman milk but it is recommended that these drugs notbe given to nursing mothers Thiazolidinediones These drugs are generally well tolerated however they are structurally related to an earlier drug troglitazone which was associated with liverfunction problems It is strongly recommended that allpatients treated with pioglitazone or rosiglitazone haveregular liver function monitoring The drugs are classified as pregnancy category C based on evidence of inhibition of fetal growth in rats given more than four timesthe normal human dose It is important that rigid bloodglucose control be maintained during pregnancy andpregnant women should be switched to insulin It is notknown whether the thiazolidinediones are excreted inhuman milk however they have been identified in themilk of lactating rats It is recommended that these drugsnot be administered to nursing mothers Interactions The sulfonylureas have a particularly long list of drug interactions several of which may be severeReview specific

Seizure A sudden attack spasm or convulsionPurpose Antidiarrheal drugs help control diarrhea and some of the symptoms that go along with it An averagehealthy person has anywhere from three bowel movements a day to three a week depending on that personsdiet Normally the stool the material that is passed in abowel movement has a texture something like clay Withdiarrhea bowel movements may be more frequent andthe texture of the stool is thin and sometimes watery Diarrhea is not a disease but a symptom of some other problem The symptom may be caused by eating or drinking food or water that is contaminated with bacteria viruses or parasites or by eating something that is difficult todigest People who have trouble digesting lactose milksugar for example may get diarrhea if they eat dairyproducts Some cases of diarrhea are caused by stress while others are brought on by taking certain medicines Description Antidiarrheal drugs work in several ways The drug loperamide found in Imodium AD for example slowsthe passage of stools through the intestines This allowsmore time for water and salts in the stools to beabsorbed back into the body Adsorbents such as attapulgite found in Kaopectate pull diarrheacausing substances from the digestive tract However they may alsopull out substances that the body needs such asenzymes and nutrients Bismuth subsalicylate the ingredient in PeptoBismol decreases the secretion of fluidinto the intestine and inhibits the activity of bacteria Itnot only controls diarrhea but relieves the cramps thatoften accompany diarrhea These medicines come in liquid tablet caplet and chewable tablet forms and can be bought without aphysicians prescription Recommended dosage The dose depends on the type of antidiarrheal drug Read and follow the directions on the product label Forquestions about dosage check with a physician or pharmacist Never take larger or more frequent doses and donot take the drug for longer than directed Precautions Diarrhea usually improves within hours If the problem lasts longer or if it keeps coming back diarrheacould be a sign of a more serious problem Anyone whohas any of the symptoms listed below should

confuse this harmless darkening of the stool withthe black tarry stools that are a sign of bleeding in theintestinal tract Children with flu or chicken pox should not be given bismuth subsalicylate It can lead to Reyes syndrome a lifethreatening condition that affects the liver and centralnervous system To be safe never give bismuth subsalicylate to a child under years without consulting a physician Children may have unpredictable reactions to otherantidiarrheal drugs Loperamide should not be given to children under six years and attapulgite should not be given tochildren under three years unless directed by a physician Anyone who has a history of liver disease or who has been taking antibiotics should check with his or her physician before taking the antidiarrheal drug loperamide A physician should also be consulted beforeanyone with acute ulcerative colitis or anyone who has been advised to avoid constipation uses the drug Loperamide should not be used by people whose diarrhea is caused by certain infections such as salmonella or shigella To be safe check with a physicianbefore using this drug Anyone who has a medical condition that causes weakness should check

RossFlanigan Antidiuretic hormone ADH test Definition Antidiuretic hormone ADH test also called the Vasopressin test is a test for the antidiuretic hormonewhich is released from the pituitary gland and acts on thekidneys to increase their reabsorption of water into theblood Purpose An ADH test is used to aid in the diagnosis of dia betes insipidus or the syndrome of inappropriate ADH called SIADH Precautions Certain drugs can either increase or decrease ADH levels Drugs that increase ADH levels include acetaKEY TERMS Colitis Inflammation of the colon large bowel Dehydration Excessive loss of water from the body Enzyme A type of protein produced in the body that brings about or speeds up chemical reactions Nutrient A food substance that provides energy or is necessary for growth and repair Examples ofnutrients are vitamins minerals carbohydratesfats and proteinsminophen barbiturates cholinergic agents estrogen nicotine oral hypoglycemia agents some diuretics eg thiazides cyclophosphamide narcotics and tricyclic antidepressants Drugs that decrease ADH levelsinclude alcohol betaadrenergic agents morphine antagonists and phenytoin Dilantin Description The purpose of ADH is to control the amount of water reabsorbed by the kidneys Water is continuallybeing taken into the body in food and drink as well asbeing produced by chemical reactions in cells Water isalso continually lost in urine sweat feces and in thebreath as water vapor ADH release helps maintain theoptimum amount of water in the body when there is anincrease in the concentration of the blood serum or adecrease in blood volume Physical stress surgery and high levels of anxiety can also stimulate ADH Various factors can affect ADH production thereby disturbing the bodys water balance For example alcoholconsumption reduces ADH production by direct action onthe brain resulting in a temporarily increased productionof urine This may also occur in diabetes insipidus whenthe pituitary gland produces insufficient ADH or rarelywhen the kidneys fail to respond to ADH The reverseeffect of water retention can result from temporarilyincreased ADH production after a major operation oraccident Water retention may also be caused by thesecretion of ADH by some tumors especially of the lung Preparation The test requires collection of a blood sample The patient must be fasting nothing to eat or drink for hours be adequately hydrated and limit physical activityfor hours before the test Risks Risks for this test are minimal but may include slight bleeding from the blooddrawing site fainting or feeling lightheaded after venipuncture or hematomablood accumulating under the puncture site Normal results ADH normal ranges are laboratoryspecific but can range from pgml or ngL SI units Abnormal results Patients who are dehydrated who have a decreased amount of blood in the body hypovolemia or who areundergoing severe physical stress eg trauma pain or GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

inadequateamounts of antidiuretic hormone ADH or thekidneys are unable to respond to release of thehormone Primary symptoms are excessive urination and constant thirst Pituitary gland The pituitary gland is sometimes referred to as the master gland As the most important of the endocrine glands glands which releasehormones directly into the bloodstream it regulatesand controls not only the activities of otherendocrine glands but also many body processesfungus A fungus is an organism that can be either one celled or filamentous Unlike a plant which makes itsown food or an animal which eats plants or other animals a fungus survives by invading and living off otherliving things Fungi thrive in moist dark places including some parts of the body Fungal infections can either be systemic meaning that the infection is deep or topical dermatophyticmeaning that the infection is superficial and occurs on theskin Additionally yeast infections can affect the mucousmembranes of the body Fungal infections on the skin areusually treated with creams or ointments topical antifungal drugs However systemic infections yeast infectionsor topical infections that do not clear up after treatmentwith creams or ointments may need to be treated with systemic antifungal drugs These drugs are used for exampleto treat common fungal infections such as tinea ring worm which occurs on the skin or candidiasis a yeast infection also known as trush which can occur in thethroat in the vagina or in other parts of the body They arealso used to treat other deep fungal infections such ashistoplasmosis blastomycosis and aspergillosis which can affect the lungs and other organs They are sometimesused to prevent or treat fungal infections in people whoseimmune systems are weakened such as bone marrow ororgan transplant patients and people with AIDS Description Antifungal drugs are categorized depending on their route or site of action their mechanism of action andtheir chemical nature Systemic antifungal drugs such as capsofungin Can cidas flucytosine fluconazole Diflucan itraconazoleSporanox ketoconazole Nizoral and miconazoleMonistat IV are available only by prescription They areavailable in tablet capsule liquid and injectable forms Recommended dosage The recommended dosage depends on the type of antifungal drug and the nature and extent of fungal infection being treated Doses may also be different for different patients The prescribing physician or the pharmacistcan provide dosage information Systemic antifungaldrugs must be taken exactly as directed Itraconazole andketoconazole should be taken with food Fungal infections can take a long time to clear up so it may be necessary to take the medication for severalmonths or even for a year or longer

Inflammation Pain redness swelling and heat that usually develop in response to injury or illnessAntihelminthic drugs Definition Antihelminthic drugs are used to treat parasitic infestations Purpose Parasitic infestations are caused by protozoa or worms gaining entry into the body Most of these organisms cause infections by being ingested in the form ofeggs or larvae usually present on contaminated food orclothing while others gain entry through skin abrasionsCommon parasitic infestations include amebiasis malar iagiardiasis hookworm pinworm threadworm whip worm and tapeworm infestations Once in the body parasitic worms may go unnoticed if they cause no severesymptoms However if they multiply rapidly and spread toa major organ they can cause very serious and even lifethreatening conditions Antihelminthic drugs are prescribed to treat these infestations They function either bydestroying the worms on contact or by paralyzing them orby altering the permeability of their plasma membranesThe dead worms then pass out of the body in the feces Description Antihelminthic drugs are available only with a pre scription and are available as liquids tablets or capsulesSome commonly used antihelminthics include albendazole Albenza mebendazole Vermox niclosamideNiclocide oxamniquine Vansil praziquantel Biltricide pyrantel Antiminth pyantel pamoate Antiminthand thiabendazole Mintezol Some types of parasiticinfestations are rarely seen in the United States thus thecorresponding antihelminthic drugs are not widely distributed and need to be obtained from the United StatesCenter for Disease Control CDC when required Theseinclude for example bitional and ivermectin used to treatonchocerciasis infestations Other antihelminthic drugssuch as diethylcarbamazepine citrate Hetrezan usedfor treatment of roundworms and other parasites is supplied directly by its manufacturer when needed Most antihelminthic drugs are only active against spe cific parasites some are also toxic Before treatment theparasites must therefore be identified using tests that lookfor parasites eggs or larvae in feces urine blood sputumor tissues Thus niclosamide is used against tapewormsbut will not be effective for the treatment of pinworm orroundworm infestations because it acts by inhibiting ATPproduction in tapeworm cells Thiabendazole Mintezoleis the

of the family Trichuridae with a body that is thick at one end andvery long and slender at the other end treated The number of doses per day the time between doses and the length of treatment will also depend onthese factors Antihelminthic drugs must be taken exactly as directed to completely rid the body of the parasitic infestation and for as long as directed A second round oftreatment may be required to ensure that the infection hascompletely cleared GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Antihelminthic drugsGEM to A PM Page Precautions Some antihelminthic drugs work best when ingested along with fatty foods such as milk or ice cream Oraldrugs should be taken with water during or after mealsThe prescribing physician should be informed if thepatient has a lowfat or other special diet Some antihelminthic drugs such as praziquantel come in chewable form These tablets should not bechewed or kept in the mouth but should swallowed wholebecause their bitter taste may cause gagging or vomiting Antihelminthic drugs sometimes need to be taken with other medications For example steroids such asprednisone are also prescribed together with the antihelminthic drug for tapeworm to reduce the inflammation that the worm may cause When required pre or posttreatment purges are also performed with magnesium or sodium sulfate Regular medical visits are recommended for people affected by parasitic infestations The physician monitorswhether the infection is clearing or not and also keepstrack of unwanted side effects The prescribing physicianshould be informed if symptoms do not disappear or ifthey get worse Hookworm or whipworm infections are also treated with iron supplements along with the antihelminthic prescription Some types of parasitic infestations eg pinworms can be passed from one person to another It is then oftenrecommended that everyone in the household of aninfected person be asked to also take the prescribed antihelminthic drug Risks People with the following medical conditions may have adverse reactions to antihelminthic drugs The prescribing physician should accordingly be informed if anyof these conditions are present Allergies Anyone who has had adverse reactions to antihelminthic drugs should inform the prescribingphysician before taking the drugs again The physicianshould also be informed about any other preexistingallergies Ulcers Antihelminthic drugs are also contraindicated for persons diagnosed with ulcers of the digestive tractespecially ulcerative colitis Pregnancy There is research evidence reporting that some antihelminthic drugs cause birth defects or mis carriage in animal studies No human birth defects have been reported but antihelminthic drugs are usually notrecommended for use during pregnancy Pregnant women should accordingly inform the prescribing physician Breastfeeding Some antihelminthic drugs can pass into breast milk Breastfeeding may have to be discontinueduntil the antihelminthic treatment has ended and breastfeeding mothers must also inform the prescribingphysician Other risk conditions Any of the following medical conditions should also be reported to the prescribingphysician Crohns disease liver disease kidney dis ease and worm cysts in the eyes Common side effects of antihelminthic drugs include dizziness drowsiness headache sweating dryness of the mouth and eyes and ringing in the ears Anyone takingthese drugs should accordingly avoid driving operatingmachines or other activities that may be dangerous untilthey know how they are affected by the drugs Side effectsusually wear off as the body adjusts to the drug and do notusually require medical treatment Thiabendazole maycause the urine to have an unusual odor that can last for aday after the last dose Other side effects of antihelminthicdrugs such as loss of appetite diarrhea nausea vomit ing or abdominal cramps are less common If they occurthey are usually mild and do not require medical attention More serious side effects such as fever chills con fusion extreme weakness hallucinations severe diar rhea nausea or vomiting skin rashes low back pain dark urine blurred vision seizures and jaundice have been reported in some cases The patients physicianshould be informed immediately if any should developAs a rule anyone who has unusual symptoms after starting treatment with antihelminthic drugs should notify theprescribing physician Antihelminthic drugs may interact with each other or with other drugs whether prescribed or not For example it has been reported that use of the antihelminthicdrugs pyrantel and piperazine together lowers the efficiency of pyrantel Similarly combining a given antihelminthic drug with another medication may increasethe risk of side effects from either drug Nancy RossFlanigan Antihemorrhoid drugs Definition Antihemorrhoid drugs are medicines that reduce the swelling and relieve the discomfort of hemorrhoids swellings in the area around the anus GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Antihemorrhoid drugsGEM to A PM Page Purpose Hemorrhoids are bulges in the veins that supply blood to the skin and membranes of the area around theanus They may form for various reasons Frequent heavylifting sitting for long periods or straining to have bowelmovements may put stress on anal tissues which can lead to hemorrhoids Some women develop hemorrhoids during pregnancy as the expanding uterus puts pressure on the anal tissues The strain of labor and delivery can alsocause hemorrhoids or make existing hemorrhoids worseHemorrhoids sometimes result from certain medicalproblems such as tumors pressing on the lower bowel The main symptoms of hemorrhoids are bleeding from the rectum especially after a bowel movement anditching burning pain and general discomfort in the anal area Overthecounter antihemorrhoid products canrelieve many of these symptoms The products containcombinations of four main types of ingredients local anesthetics such as benzocaine lidocaine and tetracaine to temporarily relieve the pain vasoconstrictors such as epinephrine base epinephrine hydrochloride ephedrine sulfate and phenylephrinehydrochloride that reduce swelling and relieve itchingand discomfort by tightening blood vessels astringents drying agents such as witch hazel calamine and zinc oxide These help shrink hemorrhoids by pulling water out of the swollen tissue Thisin turn helps relieve itching burning and irritation protectants such as cocoa butter lanolin glycerin min eral oil and shark liver oil which soothe irritated tissuesand form a

that block the action of histamine a compound released in allergic inflammatoryreactions at the H receptor sites responsible for imme diate hypersensitivity reactions such as sneezing anditching Members of this class of drugs may also be used for their side effects including sedation and antiemesis prevention of nausea and vomiting GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AntihistaminesGEM to A PM Page Purpose Antihistamines provide their primary action by blocking histamine Hat the receptor site They have no effect on rate of histamine release nor do they inactivatehistamine By inhibiting the activity of histamine theycan reduce capillary fragility which produces the erythema or redness associated with allergic reactions Theywill also reduce histamineinduced secretions includingexcessive tears and salivation Additional effects varywith the individual drug used Several of the older drugscalled firstgeneration antihistamines bind nonselectively to H receptors in the central nervous system as well as to peripheral receptors and can produce sedationinhibition of nausea and vomiting and reduction ofmotion sickness The secondgeneration antihistamines bind only to peripheral H receptors and reduce allergic response with little or no sedation The firstgeneration antihistamines may be divided into several chemical classes The side effect profilewhich also determines the uses of the drugs will vary bychemical class The alkylamines include brompheniramine Dimetapp and chlorpheniramine ChlorTrimeton These agents cause relatively little sedation and areused primarily for treatment of allergic reactions Promethazine Phenergan in contrast is a phenothiazine chemically related to the major tranquilizers and while it isused for treatment of allergies may also be used as a

the piperadine class andare essentially nonsedating Recommended dosage Dosage varies with drug patient and intended use Consult more detailed references for further information When used for control of allergic reactions antihista mines should be taken on a regular schedule rather than onan asneeded basis since they have no effect on histamineitself nor on histamine already bound to the receptor

Purpose The overall class of antihypertensive agents lowers blood pressure although the mechanisms of action varygreatly Within this therapeutic class there are severalsubgroups There are a very large number of drugs used tocontrol hypertension and the drugs listed below are rep resentatives but not the only members of their classes The calcium channel blocking agents also called slow channel blockers or calcium antagonists inhibit themovement of ionic calcium across the cell membraneThis reduces the force of contraction of muscles of theheart and arteries Although the calcium channel block ersare treated as a group there are four different chemi cal classes leading to significant variations in the activity of individual drugs Nifedipine Adalat Procardia hasthe greatest effect on the blood vessels while verapamilCalan Isoptin and diltiazem Cardizem have a greatereffect on the heart muscle itself Peripheral vasodilators such as hydralazine Apresoline isoxuprine Vasodilan and minoxidil Loniten act by relaxing blood vessels There are several groups of drugs which act by reduc ing adrenergic nerve stimulation the excitatory nervestimulation that causes contraction of the muscles in thearteries veins and heart These drugs include the betaadrenergic blockers and alphabeta adrenergic blockersThere are also nonspecific adrenergic blocking agents Betaadrenergic blocking agents include propranolol Inderal atenolol Tenormin and pindolol ViskenPropranolol acts on the betaadrenergic receptors anywhere in the body and has been used as a treatment foremotional anxiety and rapid heart beat Atenolol andacebutolol Sectral act specifically on the nerves of the heart and circulation There are two alphabeta adrenergic blockers labetolol Normodyne Trandate and carvedilol CoregThese work similarly to the beta blockers Angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors ACE inhibitors act by inhibiting the production of angiotensinII a substance that both induces constriction of bloodvessels and retention of sodium which leads to waterretention and increased blood volume There are ACEinhibitors currently marketed in the United Statesincluding captopril Capoten benazepril Lotensinenalapril Vasotec and quinapril Acupril The primarydifference between these drugs is their onset and duration of action The ACE II inhibitors losartan Cozaar candesar tan Atacand irbesartan Avapro telmisartanMicardis valsartan Diovan and eprosartan Tevetendirectly inhibit the effects of ACE II rather than blockingits production Their actions are similar to the ACEinhibitors but they appear to have a more favorable sideeffect and safety profile In addition to these drugs other classes of drugs have been used to lower blood pressure most notably thethiazide diuretics There are thiazide diuretics mar keted in the United States including hydrochlorothiazideHydrodiuril Esidrex indapamide Lozol polythiazideRenese and hydroflumethiazide Diucardin Thedrugs in this class appear to lower blood pressurethrough several mechanisms By promoting sodium lossthey lower blood volume At the same time the pressureof the walls of blood vessels the peripheral vascularresistance is lowered

uric acid Precautions Before taking any medication patients should notify their physician of all other medications that they are currently taking Patients should also notify their physicianof any health problems they are currently experiencingPatients must notify physicians if they have kidney problems since this might affect the type of drug administered Patients must also notify their

weight avoid excess alcohol consumption andavoid foods high in purines such as asparagus sardineslobster avocado and peas Description Gout and hyperuricemia Persons with high levels of uric acid hyper uricemia may experience gout Commonly gout occursin males in their s and s Gout is defined by theattacks of arthritic painful reddened joints and is oftenaccompanied by hard lumps in the painful joints Themost common joint affected is the big toe Kidney stones andor poor kidney function may also be associ ated with hyperuricemia but may not be considered goutif the patient does not have painful joints In persons withgout and associated symptoms uric acid forms crystalswhich then cause the aforementioned symptomsAlthough uric acid levels must be high in order forpatients to have crystals form and therefore have goutmost persons with high uric acid levels dont ever havesymptoms Thus recent criteria for use of antihyperuricemic agents suggest that patients who have neverexperienced symptoms of gout should not receive drugtherapy unless their hyperuricemia is associated withcancer may lead to kidney damage or certain rare GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Antihyperuricemic drugsGEM to A PM Page genetic disorders McGill Rheumatologist University of Sydney Australia Acute gout attacks When patients experience acute attacks of gout drugs that lower the levels of uric acid can cause an acute goutattack or cause an attack to become more severe Thusdrugs that lower uric acid levels and are used to treat goutin the long term are not used in the short term Medications used in acute gout attacks include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as indomethacin colchicineand corticosteroids Colchicine causes side effects in a large number of individuals usually diarhhea The mostimportant factor in the effective treatment of gout may notbe the drug used but how quickly it is administered afteran acute attack has begun Longterm treatment Longterm treatment of gout or hyperuricemia usu ally involves one of four drugs allopurinol probenicidsulphinpyrazone or benzbromarone as of this printingin benzbromarone is not available for use in theUnited States While allopurinol decreases the amountof uric acid that is produced and may help prevent acuteattacks of gout the other drugs all increase the rate atwhich uric acid is excreted in the urine As previouslymentioned lowering the concentration of uric acid cancause gout attacks Thus patients taking these medications should have the dose slowly increased and uricacid levels slowly lowered to prevent acute attacks ofgout Patients may also be treated with colchicine or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to prevent acuteattacks of gout corticosteroids are not used in this scenario because over the long term corticosteroids havedeleterious side effects Michael V Zuck PhD Antiinsomnia drugs Definition Antiinsomnia drugs are medicines that help people fall asleep or stay

attacks in people with verysevere or frequent migraines Description Migraine is thought to be caused by electrical and chemical imbalances in certain parts of the brain Theseimbalances affect the blood vessels in the brainfirsttightening them up then widening them As the blood vessels widen they stimulate the release of chemicals thatincrease sensitivity to pain and cause inflammation

Antimyocardial antibody test Definition Testing for antimyocardial antibodies is done when evaluating a person for heart damage or heart disease Purpose Antimyocardial antibodies are autoantibodies

material they inappropriately attack the bodys own cells Antimyocardial antibodiesattack a persons heart muscle or myocardium This test may be done on a person who recently had trauma to the heart such as heart surgery or a myocardialinfarction heart attack It also may be done on some one with heart disease such as cardiomyopathy orrheumatic fever Although the presence of antimyocardial antibodies does not diagnose heart damage or disease there is aconnection between the presence of these antibodies anddamage to the heart The amount of damage howevercannot be predicted by the amount of antibodies GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Antimyocardial antibody testGEM to A PM Page These antibodies usually appear after heart surgery or the beginning of disease but they may be presentbefore surgery or the onset of disease In of peoplewith myocardial infarction and of people havingheart surgery antimyocardial antibodies will appear within two to three weeks and stay for three to eight weeks Description A mL sample of venous blood is drawn from the patients arm in the region of the inner elbow Antimyocardial antibodies are detected by combining a patientsserum clear thin sticky fluid in blood with cells fromanimal heart tissue usually that of a monkey Antimyocardial antibodies in the serum bind to the heart tissue cells Afluorescent dye is then added to the mixture This dye willattach to any antibodies and heart tissue cells boundtogether The final mixture is studied under a microscopethat is designed to show fluorescence If fluorescent cellsare seen under the microscope the test is positive When the test is positive the next step is to find out how much antibody is present The patients serum isdiluted or titered and the test is done again The serum isthen further diluted and the test repeated until the serum isso dilute that fluorescence is no longer seen The last dilution that showed fluorescence is the titer reported Preparation No fasting or special prepartion is needed Before the test is done it should be explained to the patient Aftercare Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture site after the blood is drawn or the person may feel dizzyor faint Pressure to the puncture site until the bleedingstops reduces bruising Warm packs on the puncture siterelieve discomfort Normal results Antimyocardial antibodies are not normally seen in

against foreign materialincluding bacteria viruses and fungi as normal antibodies do they attack the bodys own cells Autoimmune and rheumatic diseases can be difficult to diagnose People with the same disease can have verydifferent symptoms A helpful strategy in the diagnosisof these diseases is to find and identify an autoantibodyin the persons blood The antinuclear antibody test looks for a group of autoantibodies that attack substances found in the centernucleus of all cells It is useful as a screen for manyautoantibodies associated with diseases that affect theentire body systemic diseases This test is particularly useful when diagnosing a person with symptoms of SLE an illness that affectsmany body organs and tissues If the test is negative it isunlikely that the person has SLE if the test is positivemore tests are done to confirm whether the person hasSLE or another related disease Other diseases such asscleroderma Sjgrens syndrome Raynauds disease rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune hepatitis often have a positive test for antinuclear antibodies Description Five to mL of blood is needed for this test The antinuclear antibody test is done by adding a personsserum to commercial cells mounted on a microscopeslide If antinuclear antibodies are in the serum they bindto the nuclei of cells on the slide Next a second antibody is added to the mixture This antibody is taggedwith a fluorescent dye so that it can be seen The secondantibody attaches to any antibodies and cells boundtogether and because of the fluorescent tag the areaswith antinuclear antibodies seem to glow or fluorescewhen the slide is viewed under an ultraviolet microscope If fluorescent cells are seen the test is positive When positive the serum is diluted or titered and thetest done again These steps are repeated until the serumis so dilute it no longer gives a positive result The lastdilution that shows fluorescence is the titer reported The pattern of fluorescence within the cells gives the physician clues as to what the disease might be The testresult includes the titer and the pattern This test is also called the fluorescent antinuclear antibody test or FANA Results are

Definition Antiparkinson drugs are medicines that relieve the symptoms of Parkinsons disease and other forms of parkinsonism Purpose Antiparkinson drugs are used to treat symptoms of parkinsonism a group of disorders that share four mainsymptoms tremor or trembling in the hands arms legsjaw and face stiffness or rigidity of the arms legs andtrunk slowness of movement bradykinesia and poorbalance and coordination Parkinsons disease is the mostcommon form of parkinsonism and is seen more frequently with advancing age Other forms of the disordermay result from viral infections environmental toxinscarbon monoxide poisoning and the effects of treat ment with antipsychotic drugs The immediate cause of Parkinsons disease or Parkinsonianlike syndrome is the lack of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain Drug therapy may take several forms including replacement of dopamine inhibitionof dopamine metabolism to increase the effects of thedopamine already present or sensitization of dopaminereceptors Drugs may be used singly or in combination Description Levodopa Larodopa is the mainstay of Parkinsons treatment The drug crosses the bloodbrain barrier and isconverted to dopamine The drug may be administeredalone or in combination with carbidopa Lodosyn which GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Antiparkinson drugsGEM to A PM Page inhibits the enzyme responsible for the destruction of lev odopa The limitation of levodopa or levodopacarbidopatherapy is that after approximately two years of treatmentthe drugs cease to work reliably This has been termed theonoff phenomenon Additional treatment strategieshave been developed to retard the progression of Parkinsonism or to find alternative approaches to treatment Anticholinergic drugs reduce some of the symptoms of Parkinsonism and reduce the reuptake of dopaminethereby sustaining the activity of the natural neurohormone They may be effective in all stages of the diseaseAll drugs with anticholinergic properties the naturallyoccurring belladonna alkaloids atropine scopolaminehyoscyamine some antihistamines with anticholinergic properties and synthetics such as benztropin Cogentinprocyclidine Kemadrin and

Parlodel is a prolactin inhibitor which is used for a variety of indications includingamenorrheagalactorrhea female infertility and acromegaly It appears to work by direct stimulation ofthe dopamine receptors Bromocriptine is used as a lateadjunct to levodopa therapy and may permit reduction inlevodopa dosage Pergolide Permax is similar tobromocriptine but has not been studied as extensively inParkinsons disease Entacapone Comtan appears to act by maintaining levels of dopamine through enzyme inhibition It is usedas an adjunct to levodopa was the patient is beginning toexperience the onoff effect Tolcapone Tasmar is asimilar agent but has demonstrated the potential forinducing severe liver failure As such tolcapone isreserved for cases where all other adjunctive therapieshave failed or are contraindicatedSelegeline Carbex Eldepryl is a selective monoamine oxidase B MAOB inhibitor however itsmechanism of action in Parkinsonism is unclear sinceother drugs with MAOB inhibition have failed to showsimilar antiParkinsonian effects Selegeline is used primarily as an adjunct to levodopa although some studieshave indicated that the drug may be useful in the earlystages of Parkinsonism and may delay the progressionof the disease Pramipexole Mirapex and ropinirole Requip are believed to act by direct stimulation of the dopamine receptors in the brain They may be used alone in early Parkisonsdisease or as adjuncts to levodopa in advanced stages Recommended dosage Dosages of antiParkinsonian medications must be highly individualized All doses must be carefully

Antipsychotic drugs are a class of medicines used to treat psychosis and other mental and emotional condi tions Purpose Psychosis is defined as a serious mental disorder as schizophrenia characterized by defective or lost contact with reality often with hallucinations or delu sions Psychosis is an endstage condition arising from avariety of possible causes Antipsychotic drugs controlthe symptoms of psychosis and in many cases are effective in controlling the symptoms of other disorders thatmay lead to psychosis including bipolar mood disorderformerly termed manicdepressive in which the patientcycles from severe depression to feelings of extremeexcitation This class of drugs is primarily composed ofthe major tranquilizers however lithium carbonate adrug that is largely specific to bipolar mood disorder iscommonly classified among the antipsychotic agents Description The antipsychotic agents may be divided by chemi cal class The phenothiazines are the oldest group andinclude chlorpromazine Thorazine mesoridazine Serentil prochlorperazine Compazine and thioridazineMellaril These drugs are essentially similar in actionand adverse effects They may also be used as antiemetics although prochlorperazine is the drug most oftenused for this indication The phenylbutylpiperadines are haloperidol Haldol and pimozide Orap They find primary use in control ofTourettes syndrome Haloperidol has been extremelyuseful in controlling aggressive behavior The debenzapine derivatives clozapine Clozaril loxapine Loxitane olanzapine Zyprexa and quetiapine Seroquel have been effective in controlling psychotic symptoms that have not been responsive to otherclasses of drugs The benzisoxidil group is composed of resperidone Resperidal and ziprasidone Geodon Resperidone hasbeen found useful for controlling bipolar mood disorderwhile ziprasidone is used primarily as secondline treatment for schizophreniaIn addition to these drugs the class of antipsychotic agents includes lithium carbonate Eskalith Lithonatewhich is used for control of bipolar mood disorder andthiothixene Navane which is used in the treatment ofpsychosis Recommended dosage Dose varies with the drug condition being treated and patient response See specific references Precautions Neuroleptic malignant syndrome NMS NMS is a rare idiosyncratic combination of extrapyramidal symptoms EPS hyperthermia and autonomic disturbanceOnset may be hours to months after drug initiation butonce started proceeds rapidly over to hours It ismost commonly associated with haloperidol longactingfluphenazine but has occurred with thiothixene thioridazine and clozapine and may occur with other agentsNMS is potentially fatal and requires intensive symptomatic treatment and immediate discontinuation of neuroleptic treatment There is no established treatmentMost patients who develop NMS will have the sameproblem if the drug is restarted Tardive dyskinesia TD Tardive dyskinesia is a syndrome of involuntary movements that may appear inpatients treated with neuroleptic drugs Although prevalence of TD appears highest among the elderly especially women it is impossible to predict which patients arelikely to develop the syndrome Both the risk of developing TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversibleare increased with higher doses and longer periods oftreatment The syndrome can develop after short treatment periods at low doses Anticholinergic agents mayworsen these effects Clozapine has occasionally beenuseful in controlling the TD caused by other antipsychotic drugs Agranulocytosis has been associated with clozapine This is a potentially fatal reaction but can be preventedwith careful monitoring of the white blood count There are no wellestablished risk factors for developing agranulocytosis and so all patients treated with this drug mustfollow the clozapine Patient Management System Formore information call Anticholinergic effects particularly dry mouth have been reported

The best known of this group is HIV humanimmunodeficiency virus the causative agent of AIDS Purpose Antiretroviral agents are virustatic agents which block steps in the replication of the virus The drugs arenot curative however continued use of drugs particularly in multidrug regimens significantly slows diseaseprogression Description There are three main types of antiretroviral drugs although only two steps in the viral replications processare blocked Nucleoside analogs or nucleoside reversetranscriptase inhibitors NRTIs such as didanosine ddIVidex lamivudine TC Epivir stavudine dT Zeritzalcitabine ddC Hivid and zidovudine AZT Retroviract by inhibiting the enzyme reverse transcriptaseBecause a retrovirus is composed of RNA the virus mustmake a DNA strand in order to replicate itself Reversetranscriptase is an enzyme that is essential to making theDNA copy The nucleoside reverse transcriptaseinhibitors are incorporated into the DNA strand This is afaulty DNA molecule which is incapable of reproducing The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase in hibitors NNRTIs such as delavirdine Rescriptor loviride and nevirapine Viramune act by bindingdirectly to the reverse transcriptase molecule inhibitingits activity Protease inhibitors such as indinavir Crixivan nelfinavir Viracept ritonavir Norvir and saquinavirInvirase act on the enzyme protease which is essentialfor the virus to break down the proteins in infected cellsWithout this essential step the virus produces immaturecopies of itself which are noninfectious Because HIV mutates readily the virus can develop resistance to single drug therapy However treatmentwith drug combinations appears to produce a durableresponse Proper treatment appears to slow the progression of HIV infections and reduce the frequency ofopportunistic infections Recommended dosage Doses must be individualized based on the patient and use of interacting drugs The optimum combinationsof antiretroviral drugs have not been determined nor isthere agreement on the stage of infection at which to starttreatment Precautions Although the antiretroviral drugs fall into three groups each drug has a unique pattern of adverse effectsand drug interactions Since the drugs are used in variouscombinations the frequency and severity of adverseeffects will vary with the combination Although mostdrug combinations show a higher rate of adverse eventsthat single drug therapy some patterns are not predictable For example indinavir has been reported tocause insomnia in of patients however when used in combination with

toid arthritis Purpose Rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive form of arthritis that has devastating effects on joints and general health Itis classified as an autoimmune disease because the disease is caused by the bodys own immune system actingagainst the body itself Symptoms include painful stiffswollen joints fever fatigue and loss of appetite In recent years there has been a change in attitude concerning the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis Physicians now use Disease Modifying AntiRheumatic DrugsDMARDs early in the history of the disease and areless inclined to wait for crippling stages before resortingto the more potent drugs Fuller understanding of thesideeffects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugsNSAIDs has also stimulated reliance on other types ofantirheumatic drugs Description The major classes of antirheumatic drugs include Nonsteroidal AntiInflammatory Drugs NSAIDs Drugs belonging to this class bring symptomatic reliefof both inflammation and pain but have a limited effect on the progressive bone and cartilage loss associatedwith rheumatoid arthritis They act by slowing thebodys production of prostaglandins Common NSAIDsinclude ibuprofen Motrin Nuprin or Advil naproxenNaprosyn Aleve and indomethacinIndocin Corticosteroids These drugs are very powerful anti inflammatory agents They are the synthetic analogs ofcortisone produced by the body Corticosteroids areused to reduce inflammation and suppress activity ofthe immune system The most commonly prescribedare prednisone and dexamethasone Disease Modifying AntiRheumatic Drugs DMARDs DMARDs influence the disease process itself and do notonly treat symptoms hence their name DMARDs alsohave antiinflammatory effects and most were borrowedfrom the treatment of other diseases such as cancer and malaria Antimalarials DMARDs include chloroquine Aralen and hydroxychloroquine Plaquenil PowerfulDMARDs include methotrexate Rheumatrex sulfasalazine cyclosporine azathioprine Imuran

Antirheumatic Drugs SAARDs SAARDs are a special class of DMARDs and the effect of thesedrugs is slow acting and not so quickly apparent as thatof the NSAIDs Examples are hydroxychloroquine andaurothioglucose Immunosuppresive cytotoxic drugs This class of drugs is used if treatment with NSAIDs and SAARDs haveno effect Immunosuppresive drugs have a stabilizingeffect on the immune system Since the inflammationassociated with chronic arthritis is due to malfunctionsof the immune system use of this class of drugs hasbeen shown to be beneficial for the treatment ofrheumatoid arthritis as well Examples are methotrexate mechlorethamine cyclophosphamide chlorambucil and azathioprine Recommended dosage Recommended dosage depends on the type of drug The prescribing physician or the pharmacist provideinformation for the correct dosage The drugs must betaken exactly as directed When taking methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis it should be taken only once or twice a week as pre

practical purposes antiseptics are routinely thought of as topical agents for application to skin mucous membranesand inanimate objects although a formal definitionincludes agents which are used internally such as the urinary tract antiseptics Purpose Antiseptics are a diverse class of drugs which are applied to skin surfaces or mucous membranes for theirantiinfective effects This may be either bacteriocidal orbacteriostatic Their uses include cleansing of skin andwound surfaces after injury preparation of skin surfacesprior to injections or surgical procedures and routine disinfection of the oral cavity as part of a program of oralhygiene Antiseptics are also used for disinfection of inani mate objects including instruments and furniture surfaces Commonly used antiseptics for skin cleaning include benzalkonium chloride chlorhexidine hexachlorophineiodine compounds mercury compounds alcohol andhydrogen peroxide Other agents which have been usedfor this purpose but have largely been supplanted bymore effective or safer agents include boric acid andvolatile oils such as methyl salicylate oil of wintergreen Chlorhexidine shows a high margin of safety when applied to mucous membranes and has been used in oralrinses and preoperative total body washes Benzalkonium chloride and hexachlorophine are used primarily as hand scrubs or face washes Benzalkonium mayalso find application is a disinfecting agent for instrumentsand in low concentration as a preservative for drugs including ophthalmic solutions Benzalkonium chloride is inactivated by organic compounds including soap and must notbe applied to areas which have not been fully rinsed Iodine compounds include tincture of iodine and povidone iodine compounds Iodine compounds have thebroadest spectrum of all topical antiinfectives with actionagainst bacteria fungi viruses spores protozoa andyeasts Iodine tincture is highly effective but its alcoholiccomponent is drying and extremely irritating when appliedto abraided scraped or rubbed skin Povidone iodine anorganic compound is less irritating and less toxic but notas effective Povidone iodine has been used for

effective treatment At the start of the thCentury tuberculosis was the most common cause ofdeath in the United States but was laregly eliminated with better living conditions It is most common in areasof crowding and poor ventilation suich as crowdedurban areas and prisons In some areas the AIDS epi demic has been accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of tuberculosis Some antituberculosis drugs also are used to treat or prevent other infections such as Mycobacterium avium complex MAC which causes disease throughout thebodies of people with AIDS or other diseases of theimmune system Description Antituberculosis drugs are available only with a physicians prescription and come in tablet capsule liquid and injectable forms Some commonly used antituberculosis drugs are cycloserine Seromycin ethambutol Myambutol ethionamide TrecatorSC isoniazidNydrazid Laniazid pyrazinamide rifabutinMycobutin and rifampin Rifadin Rimactane Recommended dosage The recommended

that cause tuberculosis to become resistant todrugs used to treat the disease When the bacteria becomeresistant treating the disease becomes more difficult To clear up tuberculosis completely antituberculosis drugs must be taken for as long as directed This maymean taking the medicine every day for a year or two oreven longer Symptoms may improve very quickly aftertreatment with this medicine begins However they may come back if the medicine is stopped too quickly Do notstop taking the medicine just because symptoms improve Because people may neglect to take their medication for tuberculosis it is common to have tuberculosis centersdevelop a program of Directly Observed Therapy DOTIn these programs patients come to the hospital or clinicand take their medication in front of an observer Theseprograms may be annoying to the patients but are justified by the risks to public health if tuberculosis germswhich have become resistant to drugs were to be spread Cycloserine works best when it is at constant levels in the blood To help keep levels constant take the medicine in doses spaced evenly through the day and nightDo not miss any doses If taking medicine at night interferes with sleep or if it is difficult to remember to takethe medicine during the day check with a health careprofessional for suggestions Do not take antacids that contain aluminum such as Maalox within hour of taking isoniazid as this maykeep the medicine from working Precautions Seeing a physician regularly while taking antituber culosis drugs is important The physician will check

multisystem response to a perceived threat or danger It reflects a combination of biochemicalchanges in the body the patients personal history andmemory and the social situation As far as we know anxiety is a uniquely human experience Other animals clearlyknow fear but human anxiety involves an ability to usememory and imagination to move backward and forwardin time that animals do not appear to have The anxietythat occurs in posttraumatic syndromes indicates thathuman memory is a much more complicated mental function than animal memory Moreover a large portion ofhuman anxiety is produced by anticipation of futureevents Without a sense of personal continuity over timepeople would not have the raw materials of anxiety It is important to distinguish between anxiety as a feeling or experience and an anxiety disorder as a psychiatric diagnosis A person may feel anxious withouthaving an anxiety disorder Also a person facing a clearand present danger or a realistic fear is not usually considered to be in a state of anxiety In addition anxietyfrequently occurs as a symptom in other categories ofpsychiatric disturbance Description Although anxiety is a commonplace experience that everyone has from time to time it is difficult to describeconcretely because it has so many different potential causes and degrees of intensity Doctors sometimes categorizeanxiety as an emotion or an affect depending on whether itis being described by the person having it emotion or byan outside observer affect The word emotion is general ly used for the biochemical changes and feeling state thatunderlie a persons internal sense of anxiety Affect is used to describe the persons emotional state from an observersperspective If a doctor says that a patient has an anxiousaffect he or she means that the patient appears nervous oranxious or responds to others in an anxious way forexample the individual is shaky tremulous etc Although anxiety is related to fear it is not the same thing Fear is a direct focused response to a specific eventor object and the person is consciously aware of it Mostpeople will feel fear if someone points a loaded gun atthem or if they see a tornado forming on the horizon Theyalso will recognize that they are afraid Anxiety on theother hand is often unfocused vague and hard to pindown to a specific cause In this form it is called freefloating anxiety Sometimes anxiety being experienced in thepresent may stem from an event or person that producedpain and fear in the past but the anxious individual is not consciously aware of the original source of the feeling Itis anxietys aspect of remoteness that makes it hard forpeople to compare their experiences of it Whereas mostpeople will be fearful in physically dangerous situationsand can agree that fear is an appropriate response in thepresence of danger anxiety is often triggered by objects orevents that are unique and specific to an individual Anindividual might be anxious because of a unique meaningor memory being stimulated by present circumstances notbecause of some immediate danger Another individuallooking at the anxious person from the outside may betruly puzzled as to the reason for the persons anxiety Causes and symptoms Anxiety can have a number of different causes It is a multidimensional response to stimuli in the personsenvironment or a response to an internal stimulus forexample a hypochondriacs reaction to a stomach rumbling resulting from a combination of general biologicaland individual psychological processes Physical In some cases anxiety is produced by physical respons es to stress or by certain disease processes or medications GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AnxietyGEM to A PM Page THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ANS The ner vous system of human beings is hardwired to respondto dangers or threats These responses are not subject toconscious control and are the same in humans as inlower animals They represent an evolutionary adaptationto the animal predators and other dangers with which allanimals including primitive humans had to cope Themost familiar reaction of this type is the socalled fightorflight reaction This response is the human organisms automatic red alert in a lifethreatening situationIt is a state of physiological and emotional hyperarousalmarked by high muscle tension and strong feelings offear or anger When a person has a fightorflight reaction the level of stress hormones in their blood risesThey become more alert and attentive their eyes dilatetheir heartbeat increases their breathing rate increasesand their digestion slows down allowing more energy tobe available to the muscles This emergency reaction is regulated by a part of the nervous system called the autonomic nervous system orANS The ANS is controlled by the hypothalamus a specialized part of the brainstem that is among a group ofstructures called the limbic system The limbic systemcontrols human emotions through its connections toglands and muscles it also connects to the ANS andhigher brain centers such as parts of the cerebral cortex One problem with this arrangement is that the limbicsystem cannot tell the difference between a realisticphysical threat and an anxietyproducing thought or ideaThe hypothalamus may trigger the release of stress hormones by the pituitary gland even when there is noexternal and objective danger A second problem iscaused by the biochemical side effects of too many falsealarms in the ANS When a person responds to a realdanger his or her body gets rid of the stress hormones byrunning away or by fighting In modern life howeverpeople often have fightorflight reactions in situations inwhich they can neither run away nor lash out physicallyAs a result their bodies have to absorb all the biochemical changes of hyperarousal rather than release themThese biochemical changes can produce anxious feelings as well as muscle tension and other physical symptoms associated with anxiety They may even producepermanent changes in the brain if the process occursrepeatedly Moreover chronic physical disorders such ascoronary artery disease may be worsened by anxiety as chronic hyperarousal puts undue stress on the heartstomach and other organs DISEASES AND DISORDERS Anxiety can be a symp tom of certain medical conditions Some of these diseases are disorders of the endocrine system such asCushings syndrome overproduction of cortisol by the adrenal cortex and include over or underactivity of thethyroid gland Other medical conditions that can produce anxiety include respiratory distress syndrome mitral valve prolapse porphyria and chest pain caused by inadequate blood supply to the heart angina pectoris MEDICATIONS AND SUBSTANCE USE Numerous medications may cause anxietylike symptoms as a sideeffect They include birth control pills some thyroid orasthma drugs some psychotropic agents occasionally local anesthetics corticosteroids antihypertensive drugs and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs like flurbiprofen and ibuprofen Although people do not usually think of caffeine as a drug it can cause anxietylike symptoms when consumed in sufficient quantity Patients who consume caffeine rich foods and beverages such as chocolate cocoacoffee tea or carbonated soft drinks especially colabeverages can sometimes lower their anxiety symptomssimply by reducing their intake of these substances Withdrawal from certain prescription drugs primari ly beta blockers and corticosteroids can cause anxiety Withdrawal from drugs of abuse including LSD cocaine alcohol and opiates can also cause anxiety Learned associations Some aspects of anxiety appear to be unavoidable byproducts of the human developmental processHumans are unique among animals in that they spend anunusually long period of early life in a relatively helplesscondition and a sense of helplessness can lead to anxiety The extended period of human dependency on adultsmeans that people may remember and learn to anticipate frightening or upsetting experiences long beforethey are capable enough to feel a sense of mastery overtheir environment In addition the fact that anxiety dis orders often run in families indicates that children can learn unhealthy attitudes and behaviors from parents aswell as healthy ones Also recurrent disorders in familiesmay indicate that there is a genetic or inherited component in some anxiety disorders For example there hasbeen found to be a higher rate of anxiety disorderspanic in identical twins than in fraternal twins CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND ANXIETY Re searchers in early childhood development regard anxietyin adult life as a residue of childhood memories ofdependency Humans learn during the first year of lifethat they are not selfsufficient and that their basic survival depends on the care of others It is thought that thisearly experience of helplessness underlies the most common anxieties of adult life including fear of powerlessness and fear of being unloved Thus adults can be madeanxious by symbolic threats to their sense of competence GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AnxietyGEM to A PM Page andor significant relationships even though they are no longer helpless children SYMBOLIZATION The psychoanalytic model gives considerable weight to the symbolic aspect of humananxiety examples include phobic disorders obsessionscompulsions and other forms of anxiety that are highlyindividualized The length of the human maturationprocess allows many opportunities for children and adolescents to connect their experiences with certain objectsor events that can bring back feelings in later life Forexample a person who was frightened as a child by a tallman wearing glasses may feel panicky years later bysomething that reminds him of that person or experiencewithout consciously knowing why Freud thought that anxiety results from a persons internal conflicts According to his theory people feelanxious when they feel torn between desires or urgestoward certain actions on the one hand and moralrestrictions on the other In some cases the personsanxiety may attach itself to an object that represents theinner conflict For example someone who feels anxiousaround money may be pulled between a desire to stealand the belief that stealing is wrong Money becomes asymbol for the inner conflict between doing what is considered right and doing what one wants PHOBIAS Phobias are a special type of anxiety reaction in which the persons anxiety is concentrated ona specific object or situation that the person then tries toavoid In most cases the persons fear is out of all proportion to its cause Prior to the Diagnostic and Statis tical Manual of Mental Disorders th edition DSMIV these specific phobias were called simple phobias It isestimated that of the population will develop aphobia in the course of their lives Some phobias such asagoraphobia fear of open spaces claustrophobia fear of small or confined spaces and social phobia areshared by large numbers of people Others are less common or unique to the patient Social and environmental stressors Anxiety often has a social dimension because humans are social creatures People frequently reportfeelings of high anxiety when they anticipate and therefore fear the loss of social approval or love Social phobiais a specific anxiety disorder that is marked by high levelsof anxiety or fear of embarrassment in social situations Another social stressor is prejudice People who belong to groups that are targets of bias are at higher riskfor developing anxiety disorders Some experts think forexample that the higher rates of phobias and panic dis order among women reflects their greater social and economic vulnerabilitySome controversial studies indicate that the increase in violent or upsetting pictures and stories in newsreports and entertainment may raise the anxiety level ofmany people Stress and anxiety management programsoften suggest that patients cut down their exposure toupsetting stimuli Anxiety may also be caused by environmental or occupational factors People who must live or workaround sudden or loud noises bright or flashing lightschemical vapors or similar nuisances which they cannotavoid or control may develop heightened anxiety levels Existential anxiety Another factor that shapes human experiences of anxiety is knowledge of personal mortality Humans arethe only animals that appear to be aware of their limitedlife span Some researchers think that awareness ofdeath influences experiences of anxiety from the time that a person is old enough to understand death Symptoms of anxiety In order to understand the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety it is helpful to have a basic understanding of itssymptoms SOMATIC The somatic or physical symptoms of anxiety include headaches dizziness or lightheadedness nausea andor vomiting diarrhea tingling pale com plexion sweating numbness difficulty in breathing andsensations of tightness in the chest neck shoulders orhands These symptoms are produced by the hormonalmuscular and cardiovascular reactions involved in thefightorflight reaction BEHAVIORAL Behavioral symptoms of anxiety include pacing trembling general restlessness hyperventilation pressured speech hand wringing or fingertapping COGNITIVE Cognitive symptoms of anxiety include recurrent or obsessive thoughts feelings of doom morbid or fearinducing thoughts or ideas and confusion orinability to concentrate EMOTIONAL Feeling states associated with anxiety include tension or nervousness feeling hyper orkeyed up and feelings of unreality panic or terror DEFENSE MECHANISMS In psychoanalytic theory the symptoms of anxiety in humans may arise from oractivate a number of unconscious defense mechanismsBecause of these defenses it is possible for a person tobe anxious without being consciously aware of it orappearing anxious to others These psychological defenses include GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AnxietyGEM to A PM Page Repression The person pushes anxious thoughts or ideas out of conscious awareness Displacement Anxiety from one source is attached to a different object or event Phobias are an example of themechanism of displacement in psychoanalytic theory Rationalization The person justifies the anxious feel ings by saying that any normal person would feel anxious in their situation Somatization The anxiety emerges in the form of phys ical complaints and illnesses such as recurrentheadaches stomach upsets or muscle and joint pain Delusion formation The person converts anxious feel ings into conspiracy theories or similar ideas withoutreality testing Delusion formation can involve groupsas well as individuals Other theorists attribute some drug addiction to the desire to relieve symptoms of anxiety Most addictionsthey argue originate in the use of moodaltering substances or behaviors to medicate anxious feelings Diagnosis The diagnosis of anxiety is difficult and complex because of the variety of its causes and the highly personalized and individualized nature of its symptom formationThere are no medical tests that can be used to diagnoseanxiety by itself When a doctor examines an anxiouspatient he or she will first rule out physical conditions anddiseases that have anxiety as a symptom Apart from theseexclusions the physical examination is usually inconclu sive Some anxious patients may have their blood pressureor pulse rate affected by anxiety or may look pale or perspire heavily but others may appear physically completelynormal The doctor will then take the patients medicationdietary and occupational history to see if they are takingprescription drugs that might cause anxiety if they areabusing alcohol or moodaltering drugs if they are consuming large amounts of caffeine or if their workplace isnoisy or dangerous In most cases the most importantsource of diagnostic information is the patients psychological and social history The doctor may administer a briefpsychological test to help evaluate the intensity of thepatients anxiety and some of its features Some tests thatare often given include the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and theAnxiety Disorders Interview Schedule ADIS Many doctors will check a number of chemical factors in the bloodsuch as the level of thyroid hormone and blood sugar Treatment Not all patients with anxiety require treatment but for more severe cases treatment is recommendedBecause anxiety often has more than one cause and is experienced in highly individual ways its treatment usually requires more than one type of therapy In additionthere is no way to tell in advance how patients willrespond to a specific drug or therapy Sometimes the doctor will need to try different medications or methods oftreatment before finding the best combination for theparticular patient It usually takes about six to eightweeks for the doctor to evaluate the effectiveness of atreatment regimen Medications Medications are often prescribed to relieve the phys ical and psychological symptoms of anxiety Most agentswork by counteracting the biochemical and muscularchanges involved in the fightorflight reaction Somework directly on the chemicals in the brain that arethought to underlie the anxiety ANXIOLYTICS Anxiolytics are sometimes called tranquilizers Most anxiolytic drugs are either benzodi azepines or barbiturates Barbiturates once commonly used are now rarely used in clinical practice Barbiturates work by slowing down the transmission of nerveimpulses from the brain to other parts of the body Theyinclude such drugs as phenobarbital Luminal and pentobarbital Nembutal Benzodiazepines work by relaxing the skeletal muscles and calming the limbic systemThey include such drugs as chlordiazepoxide Libriumand diazepam Valium Both barbiturates and benzodiazepines are potentially habitforming and may causewithdrawal symptoms but benzodiazepines are far lesslikely than barbiturates to cause physical dependencyBoth drugs also increase the effects of alcohol andshould never be taken in combination with it Two other types of anxiolytic medications include meprobamate Equanil which is now rarely used andbuspirone BuSpar a new type of anxiolytic that appearsto work by increasing the efficiency of the bodys ownemotionregulating brain chemicals Buspirone has several advantages over other anxiolytics It does not causedependence problems does not interact with alcohol anddoes not affect the patients ability to drive or operatemachinery However buspirone is not effective againstcertain types of anxiety such as panic disorder ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND BETABLOCKERS For some anxiety disorders such as obsessivecompulsive disor derand panic type anxiety a type of drugs used to treat depression selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs such as Prozac and Paxil are the treatment ofchoice Because anxiety often coexists with symptoms ofdepression many doctors prescribe antidepressant medications for anxiousdepressed patients While SSRIs are GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AnxietyGEM to A PM Page more common antidepressants are sometimes pre scribed including tricyclic antidepressants such asimipramine Tofranil or monoamine oxidase inhibitors MAO inhibitors such as phenelzine Nardil Betablockers are medications that work by blocking the bodys reaction to the stress hormones that arereleased during the fightorflight reaction They includedrugs like propranolol Inderal or atenolol TenorminBetablockers are sometimes given to patients with posttraumatic anxiety symptoms More commonly the betablockers are given to patients with a mild form of socialphobic anxiety such as fear of public speaking Psychotherapy Most patients with anxiety will be given some form of psychotherapy along with medications Many patientsbenefit from insightoriented therapies which aredesigned to help them uncover unconscious conflicts anddefense mechanisms in order to understand how theirsymptoms developed Patients who are extremely anxiousmay benefit from supportive psychotherapy which aims atsymptom reduction rather than personality restructuring Two newer approaches that work well with anxious patients are cognitivebehavioral therapy CBT and relaxation training In CBT the patient is taught to identifythe thoughts and situations that stimulate his or her anxiety and to view them more realistically In the behavioralpart of the program the patient is exposed to the anxietyprovoking object situation or internal stimulus like arapid heart beat in gradual stages until he or she is desensitized to it Relaxation training which is sometimescalled anxiety management training includes breathingexercises and similar techniques intended to help thepatient prevent hyperventilation and relieve the muscletension associated with the fightorflight reaction BothCBT and relaxation training can be used in group therapy as well as individual treatment In addition to CBT support groups are often helpful to anxious patients becausethey provide a social network and lessen the embarrassment that often accompanies anxiety symptoms Psychosurgery Surgery on the brain is very rarely recommended for patients with anxiety however some patients with severecases of obsessive compulsive disorder OCD havebeen helped by an operation on a part of the brain that isinvolved in OCD Normally this operation is attemptedafter all other treatments have failed Alternative treatment Alternative treatments for anxiety cover a variety of approaches Meditation and mindfulness training arethought beneficial to patients with phobias and panic disor der Hydrotherapy is useful to some anxious patients because it promotes general relaxation of the nervous system Yoga aikido tai chi and dance therapy help patients work with the physical as well as the emotional tensionsthat either promote anxiety or are created by the anxiety Homeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine approach anxiety as a symptom of a systemic disorderHomeopathic practitioners select a remedy based onother associated symptoms and the patients general constitution Chinese medicine regards anxiety as a blockageof qi or vital force inside the patients body that is most likely to affect the lung and large intestine meridian flowThe practitioner of Chinese medicine chooses acupunc ture point locations andor herbal therapy to move the qi and rebalance the entire system in relation to the lungand large intestine Aromatherapy using essential oils can also be ben eficial in treating patients with anxiety The oils godirectly to the brain via the olfactory nerve which controls smell and can have direct affect on calming the nervous system Prognosis The prognosis for resolution of anxiety depends on the specific disorder and a wide variety of factorsincluding the patients age sex general health living situation belief system social support network andresponses to different anxiolytic medications and formsof therapy Prevention Humans have significant control over thoughts and therefore may learn ways of preventing anxiety bychanging irrational ideas and beliefs Humans also havesome power over anxiety arising from social and environmental conditions Other forms of anxiety howeverare built into the human organism and its life cycle andcannot be prevented or eliminated Resources

objectactivity or situationAnxiety disorders Definition The anxiety disorders are a group of mental distur bances characterized by anxiety as a central or core symptom Although anxiety is a commonplace experience noteveryone who experiences it has an anxiety disorder Anxiety is associated with a wide range of physical illnessesmedication side effects and other psychiatric disorders The revisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Man ual of Mental Disorders DSM that took place after brought major changes in the classification of theanxiety disorders Prior to psychiatrists classifiedpatients on the basis of a theory of causality that definedanxiety as the outcome of unconscious conflicts in thepatients mind DSMIII DSMIIIR and DSMIV introduced and refined a new classifica tion that took into consideration recent discoveries aboutthe biochemical and posttraumatic origins of some typesof anxiety The present definitions are based on the external and reported symptom patterns of the disorders ratherthan on theories about their origins Description Anxiety disorders are the most common form of mental disturbance in the United States population It isestimated that million persons suffer from an anxietydisorder every year These disorders are a serious problem for the entire society because of their interferencewith patients work schooling and family life They alsocontribute to the high rates of alcohol and substanceabuse in the United States Anxiety disorders are an additional problem for health professionals because the physical symptoms of anxiety frequently bring people to primary care doctors or emergency rooms DSMIV defines twelve types of anxiety disorders in the adult population They can be grouped under sevenheadings Panic disorders with or without agoraphobia The chief characteristic of panic disorder is the occurrence of panic attacks coupled with fear of their recurrenceIn clinical settings agoraphobia is usually not a disorder by itself but is typically associated with some formof panic disorder Patients with agoraphobia are afraidof places or situations in which they might have a panicattack and be unable to leave or to find help About of patients with panic disorder develop obsessive compulsive disorder OCD Phobias These include specific phobias and social phobia A phobia is an intense irrational fear of a spe GALE

flying or driving butmany are focused on harmless animals or other objectsSocial phobia involves a fear of being humiliatedjudged or scrutinized It manifests itself as a fear ofperforming certain functions in the presence of otherssuch as public speaking or using public lavatories Obsessivecompulsive disorder OCD This disorder is marked by unwanted intrusive persistent thoughts orrepetitive behaviors that reflect the patients anxiety orattempts to control it It affects between of thepopulation and is much more common than was previously thought Stress disorders These include posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD and acute stress disorder Stress dis orders are symptomatic reactions to traumatic events inthe patients life Generalized anxiety disorder GAD GAD is the most commonly diagnosed anxiety disorder and occursmost frequently in young adults Anxiety disorders due to known physical causes These include general medical conditions or substance abuse Anxiety disorder not otherwise specified This last cate gory is not a separate type of disorder but is included tocover symptoms that do not meet the specific DSMIV criteria for other anxiety disorders All DSMIV anxiety disorder diagnoses include a criterion of severity The anxiety must be severe enoughto interfere significantly with the patients occupationalor educational functioning social activities or close relationships and other customary activities The anxiety disorders vary widely in their frequency of occurrence in the general population age of onsetfamily patterns and gender distribution The stress disorders and anxiety disorders caused by medical conditionsor substance abuse are less age and genderspecificWhereas OCD affects males and females equally GADpanic disorder and specific phobias all affect womenmore frequently than men GAD and panic disorders aremore likely to develop in young adults while phobiasand OCD can begin in childhood Anxiety disorders in children and adolescents DSMIV defines one anxiety disorder as specific to children namely separation anxiety disorder This disorder is defined as anxiety regarding separation from homeor family that is excessive or inappropriate for the childsage In some children separation anxiety takes the formof school avoidanceChildren and adolescents can also be diagnosed with panic disorder phobias generalized anxiety disorderand the post traumatic stress syndromes Causes and symptoms The causes of anxiety include a variety of individual and general social factors and may produce physicalcognitive emotional or behavioral symptoms Thepatients ethnic or cultural background may also influence his or her vulnerability to certain forms of anxietyGenetic factors that lead to biochemical abnormalitiesmay also play a role Anxiety in children may be caused by suffering from abuse as well as by the factors that cause anxiety in adults Diagnosis The diagnosis of anxiety disorders is complicated by the variety of causes of anxiety and the range of disorders that may include anxiety as a symptom Manypatients who suffer from anxiety disorders have featuresor symptoms of more than one disorder Patients whoseanxiety is accounted for by another psychic disordersuch as schizophrenia or major depression are not diag nosed with an anxiety disorder A doctor examining ananxious patient will usually begin by ruling out diseasesthat are known to cause anxiety and then proceed to takethe patients medication history in order to exclude sideeffects of prescription drugs Most doctors will ask aboutcaffeine consumption to see if the patients dietary habits are a factor The patients work and family situation willalso be discussed Laboratory tests for blood sugar andthyroid function are also common Diagnostic testing for anxiety There are no laboratory tests that can diagnose anxi ety although the doctor may order some specific tests torule out disease conditions Although there is no psychiatric test that can provide definite diagnoses of anxiety disorders there are several shortanswer interviews or symptom inventories that doctors can use to evaluate the intensity of a patients anxiety and some of its associated features These measures include the Hamilton Anxiety Scaleand the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule ADIS Treatment For relatively mild anxiety disorders psychotherapy alone may suffice In general doctors prefer to use a combination of medications and psychotherapy with moreseverely anxious patients Most patients respond better toa combination of treatment methods than to either med GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Anxiety disordersGEM to A PM Page ications or psychotherapy in isolation Because of the variety of medications and treatment approaches that areused to treat anxiety disorders the doctor cannot predictin advance which combination will be most helpful to aspecific patient In many cases the doctor will need to trya new medication or treatment over a six to

always easy to diagnose there are several reasons why it is important forpatients with severe anxiety symptoms to get help Anxiety doesnt always go away by itself it often progresses topanic attacks phobias and episodes of depressionUntreated anxiety disorders may eventually lead to a diagnosis of major depression or interfere with the patientseducation or ability to keep a job In addition many anxious patients develop addictions to drugs or alcohol whenthey try to medicate their symptoms Moreover sincechildren learn ways of coping with anxiety from their parents adults who get help for anxiety disorders are in a better position to help their families cope with factors thatlead to anxiety than those who remain untreated Alternative treatment Alternative treatments for anxiety cover a variety of approaches Meditation and mindfulness training are thought beneficial to patients with phobias and panic disorder Hydrotherapy is useful to some anxious patients because it promotes general relaxation of the nervous system Yoga aikido tai chi and dance therapy help patients work with the physical as well as the emotional tensionsthat either promote anxiety or are created by the anxiety Homeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine approach anxiety as a symptom of a systemic disorderHomeopathic practitioners select a remedy based on otherassociated symptoms and the patients general constitutionChinese medicine regards anxiety as a blockage of qio r vital force inside the patients body that is most likely toaffect the lung and large intestine meridian flow The practitioner of Chinese medicine chooses acupuncture point locations andor herbal therapy to move the qi and rebalancethe entire system in relation to the lung and large intestine Aromatherapy using essential oils can also be ben eficial in treating patients with anxiety The oils godirectly to the brain via the olfactory nerve which controls smell and can have direct affect on calming the nervous system

aneurysm is an abnormal bulging or swelling of a portion of a blood vessel The aorta which can developthese abnormal bulges is the large blood vessel that carries oxygenrich blood away from the heart to the rest ofthe body Description The aorta carries oxygenrich blood to the body and is therefore called an artery Because the aorta is anartery its walls are made of up three layers a thin innerlayer a muscular middle layer that gives the vessel itsflexibility under pressure from the filling blood and afiberlike outer layer that gives the vessel strength to notburst when the heart pumps blood to the body Aortic aneurysms occur when a weakness develops in part of the wall of the aorta three basic types are usually found If all three layers of the vessel are affected andweakness develops along an extended area of the vesselthe weakened area will appear as a large bulging regionof blood vessel this is called a fusiform aneurysm Ifweakness develops between the inner and outer layers ofthe aortic wall a bulge results as blood from the interiorof the vessel is pushed around the damaged region in thewall and collects between these layers This is called adissecting aneurysm because one layer is dissected orseparated from another If damage occurs to only the middle muscular layer of the vessel a sacklike bulge canform therefore this is a saccular aneurysm Causes and symptoms Aortic aneurysms occur in different portions of the aorta which begins in the chest at the heart and travelsdownward through the abdomen Aneurysms found inthe region of the aorta within the chest are called thoracicaortic aneurysms Aneurysms that occur in the part of theaorta within the abdomen are called abdominal aorticaneurysms Thoracic aortic aneurysms do not usually produce any noticeable symptoms However as the aneurysmbecomes larger chest shoulder neck lower back orabdominal pain can result Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur more often in men and these aneurysms can causepain in the lower back hips and abdomen A painfulabdominal aortic aneurysm usually means that theaneurysm could burst very soon Most abdominal aortic aneurysms are caused by atherosclerosis a condition caused when fat mostly cholesterol carried in the blood builds up in the innerwall of the aorta As more and more fat attaches to theaortic wall the wall itself becomes abnormally weak andoften results in an aneurysm or bulge Aortic aneurysms are also caused by a breakdown of the muscular middle layer of the artery wall by highblood pressure by direct injury to the chest and

aneurysms will survive The challenge for the physician is to decide when or if to do thepreventive surgery Prevention Aneuryms can develop in people with atherosclerosis High blood pressure can also lead to this condition Althoughno definite prevention exists lifestyle and dietary changesthat help lower blood pressure and the amount of fat in theblood stream may slow the development of aneurysms

through the inner lining andbetween the layers of the aorta The dissecting aorta usually does not burst but has an abnormal second channelwithin it Description A defect in the inner lining of the aorta allows an opening or tear to develop The aorta is the main artery ofthe body and is an area of high blood pressure When adefect develops blood pressure can force the tear to openand allow blood to pass through Since the blood is underpressure it eventually splits dissecting the middle layerof the blood vessel creating a new channel for bloodThe length of the channel grows over time and can resultin the closing off of connection points to other arteriesThis can lead to heart attack strokes abdominal pain and nerve damage Blood may leak from the dissectionand collect in the chest an around the heartA second mechanism leading to aortic dissection is medial hemorrhage A medial hemorrhage occurs in themiddle layer of the blood vessel and spills through theinner lining of the aorta wall This opening then allowsblood from the aorta to enter the vessel wall and begin adissection Approximately cases of aortic dissection occur yearly in the United States Causes and symptoms Aortic dissection is caused by a deterioration of the inner lining of the aorta There are a number of conditions that predispose a person to develop defects of theinner lining including high blood pressure Marfans disease EhlersDanlos syndrome connective tissue dis eases and defects of heart development which begin during fetal development A dissection can also occur accidentally following insertion of a catheter trauma orsurgery The main symptom is sudden intense pain Thepain can be so intense as to immobilize the patient andcause him to fall to the ground The pain is frequentlyfelt in both the chest and in the back between the shoulder blades The extent of the pain is proportional to thelength of the dissection Diagnosis The pain experienced by the patient is the first symp tom of aortic dissection and is unique The pain is usuallydescribed by the patient as tearing ripping or stabbingThis is in contrast to the pain associated with heartattacks The patient frequently has a reduced or absentpulse in the extremities A murmur may be heard if thedissection is close to the heart An enlarged aorta will usually appear in the chest x rays and ultrasound exams ofmost patients The use of a blood dye in angiogramsandor CT scans computed tomography scans will aid in diagnosing and visualizing the dissection Treatment Because of the potentially fatal nature of aortic dis section patients are treated immediately Drugs areadministered to reduce the blood pressure and heart rateIf the dissection is small drug therapy alone may beused In other cases surgery is performed In surgerydamaged sections of the aorta are removed and a synthetic graft is often used to reconstruct the damaged vessel Prognosis Depending on the nature and extent of the dissection death can occur within a few hours of the start of a dis section Approximately of untreated people die with GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Aortic dissectionGEM to A PM Page in two weeks of the start of a dissection Of those who

aortic valve regurgitation because of the abnormal reversed flowof blood leaking through the poorly functioning valve Causes and symptoms The faulty working of the aortic valve can be caused by a birth defect by abnormal widening of the aorta whichcan be caused by very high blood pressure and a variety ofother less common conditions by various diseases thatcause large amounts of swelling inflammation in differentareas of the body like rheumatic fever and although rarely by the sexually transmitted disease syphilis About of people with aortic valve insufficiency are men Rheumatic

practitioners attending a birth in deciding whether or not anewborn was in need of resuscitation Using a scoringmethod fosters consistency and standardization amongdifferent practitioners A February study publishedin the New England Journal of Medicine investigated whether Apgar scoring continues to be relevantResearchers concluded that The Apgar scoring systemremains as relevant for the prediction of neonatal survival today as it was almost years ago Description The five areas are scored as follows Appearance or color if the skin is pink all over for acrocyanosis where the trunk and head are pink but the arms and legs are blue and if the whole body isblue Newborns with naturally darker skin color willnot be pink However pallor is still noticeable especially in the soles and palms

words A person with aphasia may havedifficulty speaking reading writing recognizing thenames of objects or understanding what other peoplehave said Aphasia is caused by a brain injury as mayoccur during a traumatic accident or when the brain isdeprived of oxygen during a stroke It may also be caused by a brain tumor a disease such as Alzheimers or an infection like encephalitis Aphasia may be tem porary or permanent Aphasia does not include speechimpediments caused by loss of muscle control Description To understand and use language effectively an indi vidual draws upon word memorystored information onwhat certain words mean how to put them together andhow and when to use them properly For a majority ofpeople these and other language functions are located inthe left side hemisphere of the brain Damage to thisside of the brain is most commonly linked to the development of aphasia Interestingly however lefthandedpeople appear to have language areas in both the left andright hemispheres of the brain and as a result maydevelop aphasia from damage to either side of the brain Stroke is the most common cause of aphasia in the United States Approximately individuals sufferstrokes each year and of these individuals developsome type of aphasia Other causes of brain damageinclude head injuries brain tumors and infection Abouthalf of the people who show signs of aphasia have whatis called temporary or transient aphasia and recover completely within a few days An estimated one millionAmericans suffer from some form of permanent aphasiaAs yet no connection between aphasia and age genderor race has been foundAphasia is sometimes confused with other conditions that affect speech such as dysarthria and apraxia Thesecondition affect the muscles used in speaking rather thanlanguage function itself Dysarthria is a speech disturbance caused by lack of control over the muscles used inspeaking perhaps due to nerve damage Speech apraxia isa speech disturbance in which language comprehensionand muscle control are retained but the memory of howto use the muscles to form words is not Causes and symptoms Aphasia can develop after an individual sustains a brain injury from a stroke head trauma tumor or infection such as herpes encephalitis As a result of this injurythe pathways for language comprehension or productionare disrupted or destroyed For most people this meansdamage to the left hemisphere of the brain In to of righthanded people language centers are in the lefthemisphere and up to of lefthanded people alsohave lefthemisphere language dominance According tothe traditional classification scheme each form of aphasiais caused by damage to a different part of the left hemisphere of the brain This damage affects one or more of thebasic language functions speech naming the ability toidentify an object color or other item with an appropriateword or term repetition the ability to repeat wordsphrases and sentences hearing comprehension the ability to understand spoken language reading the ability tounderstand written words and their meaning and writingthe ability to communicate and record events with text The traditional classification scheme includes eight types of aphasia Brocas aphasia also called motor aphasia results from damage to the front portion or frontal lobe of the languagedominant area of the brain Individuals withBrocas aphasia may be completely unable to use speechmutism or may be able to use singleword statements or even full sentences though these sentences mayrequire a great deal of effort to construct Small wordssuch as conjunctions and or but and articles the ana may be omitted leading to a telegraph quality intheir speech Hearing comprehension is usually notaffected so they are able to understand other peoplesspeech and conversation and can follow commandsOften they may experience weakness on the right side oftheir bodies which can make it difficult to write Reading ability is impaired and they may have difficulty finding the right word when speaking Individuals withBrocas aphasia may become frustrated and depressedbecause they are aware of their language difficulties Wernickes aphasia is caused by damage to the side portion or temporal lobe of the languagedominant area GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AphasiaGEM to A PM Page of the brain Individuals with Wernickes aphasia speak in long uninterrupted sentences however the wordsused are frequently unnecessary or even madeup Theyhave a great deal of difficulty understanding other peoples speech sometimes to the point of being unable tounderstand spoken language at all Reading ability isdiminished and although writing ability is retainedwhat is written may be abnormal No physical symptoms such as the rightsided weakness seen withBrocas aphasia are typically observed Also in contrast to Brocas aphasia individuals with Wernickesaphasia are not aware of their language errors Global aphasia is caused by widespread damage to the language areas of the left hemisphere As a result allbasic language functions are affected but some areasmay be more affected than others For example an individual may have difficulty speaking but may be able towrite well The individual may experience weaknessand loss of feeling on the right side of their body Conduction aphasia also called associative aphasia is rather uncommon Individuals with conduction aphasiaare unable to repeat words sentences and phrasesSpeech is fairly unbroken although individuals may frequently correct themselves and words may beskipped or repeated Although able to understand spoken language it may also be difficult for the individualwith conduction aphasia to find the right word todescribe a person or object The impact of this condition on reading and writing ability varies As with othertypes of aphasia rightsided weakness or sensory lossmay be present Anomic or nominal aphasia primarily influences an individuals ability to find the right name for a personor object As a result an object may be described ratherthan named Hearing comprehension repetition reading and writing are not affected other than by thisinability to find the right name Speech is fluent exceptfor pauses as the individual tries to recall the rightname Physical symptoms are variable and some individuals have no symptoms of onesided weakness orsensory loss Transcortical aphasia is caused by damage to the lan guage areas of the left hemisphere outside the primarylanguage areas There are three types of aphasiatranscortical motor aphasia transcortical sensory aphasia and mixed transcortical aphasia All of the transcortical aphasias are distinguished from other types by theindividuals ability to repeat words phrases or sentences Other language functions may also be impairedto varying degrees depending on the extent and particular location of brain damage As researchers continue to learn more about the brains structure and function new types of aphasia arebeing recognized One newly recognized type of aphasiasubcortical aphasia mimics the symptoms of other traditional types of aphasia but involves language disordersthat are not typical This type of aphasia is associatedwith injuries to areas of the brain typically not identifiedwith language and language processing Diagnosis Following brain injury an initial bedside assessment is made to determine whether language function has beenaffected If the individual experiences difficulty communicating attempts are made to determine whether this difficulty arises from impaired language comprehension or animpaired ability to speak A typical examination involveslistening to spontaneous speech and evaluating the individuals ability to recognize and name objects comprehendwhat is heard and repeat sample words and phrases Theindividual may also be asked to read text aloud and explainwhat the passage means In addition writing ability is evaluated by having the individual copy text transcribe dictatedtext and write something without prompting GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Aphasia Brocas areaWernickes area Brocas aphasia results

injury Although there are no medical or surgical procedurescurrently available to treat this condition aphasia resulting from stroke or head injury may improve through the use of speech therapy For most individuals however theprimary emphasis is placed on making the most ofretained language abilities and learning to use othermeans of communication to compensate for lost language abilities Speech therapy is tailored to meet individual needs but activities and tools that are frequently used includethe following Exercise and practice Weakened muscles are exercised by repetitively speaking certain words or making facialexpressions such as smiling Picture cards Pictures of everyday objects are used to improve word recall and increase vocabulary The GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AphasiaGEM to A PM Page names of the objects may also be repetitively spoken aloud as part of an exercise and practice routine Picture boards Pictures of everyday objects and activi ties are placed together and the individual points tocertain pictures to convey ideas and communicate withothers Workbooks Reading and writing exercises are used to sharpen word recall and regain reading and writingabilities Hearing comprehension is also redevelopedusing these exercises Computers Computer software can be used to improve speech reading recall and hearing comprehension byfor example displaying pictures and having the individual find the right word Prognosis The degree to which an individual can recover lan guage abilities is highly dependent on how much braindamage occurred and the location and cause of the original brain injury Other factors include the individualsage general health motivation and willingness to participate in speech therapy and whether the individual is leftor right handed Language areas may be located in boththe left and right hemispheres in lefthanded individualsLefthanded individuals are therefore more likely todevelop aphasia following brain injury but because theyhave two language centers may recover more fullybecause language abilities can be recovered from eitherside of the brain The intensity of therapy and the timebetween diagnosis and the start of therapy may alsoaffect the eventual outcome Prevention Because there is no way of knowing when a stroke traumatic head injury or disease will occur very littlecan be done to prevent

located with in the hard outer shell of the bones is responsible for theproduction of all the types of blood cells The matureforms of these cells include red blood cells which carryoxygen throughout the body white blood cells whichfight infection and platelets which are involved in clotting In aplastic anemia the basic structure of the marrowbecomes abnormal and those cells responsible for generating blood cells hematopoietic cells are greatlydecreased in number or absent These hematopoieticcells are replaced by large quantities of fat Yearly aplastic anemia strikes about people in every one million Although aplastic anemia strikes bothmales and females of all ages there are two age groupsthat have an increased risk Both young adults between years of age and the elderly over the age of have higher rates of aplastic anemia than the generalpopulation While the disorder occurs worldwide youngadults in Asia have a higher disease rate than do populations in North America and Europe Causes and symptoms Aplastic anemia falls into three basic categories based on the origin of its cause idiopathic acquired andhereditary In about of cases aplastic anemia is considered to be idiopathic meaning that the cause of the disorder isunknown GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Aplastic anemiaGEM to A PM Page Acquired aplastic anemia refers to those cases where certain environmental factors and physical conditionsseem to be associated with development of the diseaseAcquired aplastic anemia can be associated with exposure to drugs especially anticancer agents antibi otics antiinflammatory agents seizure medications and antithyroid drugs drugs given to stop the functioning of an overactive thyroid exposure to radiation chemical exposure especially to the organic solvent benzene and certain insecticides infection with certain viruses especially those causing viral hepatitis as well as EpsteinBarr virus parvovirus and HIV the virus which can cause AIDS pregnancy certain other disorders including a disease called parox ysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria an autoimmune reaction called graftvshost disease which occurs when thebodys immune system attacks and destroys the bodysown cells and certain connective tissue diseases Hereditary aplastic anemia is relatively rare but does occur in Fanconis anemia ShwachmanDiamondsyndrome and dyskeratosis congenita Symptoms of aplastic anemia tend to be those of other anemias including fatigue weakness tiny red dishpurple marks petechiae on the skin evidence ofpinpoint hemorrhages into the skin evidence of abnormal bruising and bleeding from the gums nose intestine or vagina The patient is likely to appear pale If theanemia progresses decreased oxygen circulating in theblood may lead to an increase in heart rate and the sudden appearance of a new heart murmur Diagnosis The blood count in aplastic anemia will reveal low numbers of all formed blood cells Red blood cells willappear normal in size and coloration but greatlydecreased in number Cells called reticulocytes veryyoung red blood cells which are usually produced ingreat numbers by the bone marrow in order to compensate for a severe anemia will be very low in numberPlatelets and white blood cells will also be decreased innumber though normal in structure A sample of the patients bone marrow will need to be removed by needle usually from the hip bone andexamined under a microscope If aplastic anemia is present this examination will reveal very few or nohematopoietic cells and replacement with fatTreatment The first step in the treatment of aplastic anemia involves discontinuing exposure to any substance thatmay be causing the disorder Although it would seem thatblood transfusions would be helpful in this disease infact they only serve as a temporary help and may complicate future attempts at bone marrow transplantation The most successful treatment for aplastic anemia is bone marrow transplantation To do this a marrow donoroften a sibling must be identified There are a number oftissue markers which must be examined to determinewhether a bone marrow donation is likely to be compatiblewith the patients immune system Compatibility is necessary to avoid complications including the destruction ofthe donor marrow by the patients own immune system Patients who cannot undergo bone marrow trans plant can be treated with a number of agents includingantithymocyte globulin ATG cyclophosphamidesteroids and cyclosporine These agents all have thepotential to cause a number of troublesome sideeffectsFurthermore not all patients respond fully to theseagents Still even among those patients who do have agood response many later suffer a relapse return ofaplastic anemia Prognosis Aplastic anemia is a lifethreatening illness Without treatment it will almost surely progress to death Sur vival depends on how severe the disease is at diagnosiswhich type of treatment a patient is eligible for and whatkind of response their body has to that treatment Theworstprognosis type of aplastic anemia is one associatedwith very low numbers of a particular type of whiteblood cell These patients have a high chance of dyingfrom overwhelming bacterial infections In fact ofall patients treated with blood transfusions alone diewithin months to two years Patients who undergobone marrow transplantation have a chance ofbeing cured of the

cells white blood cellsand plateletsof appendectomy is most often performed during this time The diagnosis of appendicitis is most difficult in thevery young less than two years of age and in the elderly Description Appendectomy is considered a major surgical opera tion Therefore a general surgeon must perform thisoperation in the operating room of a hospital An anesthesiologist is also present during the operation to administer an anesthetic Most often the anesthesiologist uses ageneral anesthetic technique whereby patients are put tosleep and made pain free by administering drugs in the vein or by agents inhaled through a tube placed in thewindpipe Occasionally a spinal anesthetic may be used After the patient is anesthetized the general surgeon can remove the appendix either by using the traditionalopen procedure in which a cm in incision ismade in the abdomen or via laparoscopy in which four in cm incisions are made in the abdomen Traditional open appendectomy When the surgeon uses the open approach he makes an incision in the lower right section of the abdomen Mostincisions are less than in cm in length The surgeonthen identifies all of the organs in the abdomen and examines them for other disease or abnormalities The appendixis located and brought up into the wounds The surgeon separates the appendix from all the surrounding tissue andits attachment to the cecum and then removes it The sitewhere the appendix was previously attached the cecum isclosed and returned to the abdomen The muscle layersand then the skin are sewn together Laproscopic appendectomy When the surgeon conducts a laproscopic appendec tomy four incisions each about in cm in lengthare made One incision is near the umbilicus or naveland one is between the umbilicus and the pubis Twoother incisions are smaller and are in the right side of thelower abdomen The surgeon then passes a camera andspecial instruments through these incisions With the aidof this equipment the surgeon visually examines theabdominal organs and identifies the appendix Similarlythe appendix is freed from all of its attachments andremoved The place where the appendix was formerlyattached the cecum is stitched The appendix isremoved through one of the incisions The instrumentsare removed and then all of the incisions are closed Studies and opinions about the relative advantages and disadvantages of each method are divided A skilledsurgeon can perform either one of these procedures in GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AppendectomyGEM to A PM Page less than one hour However laproscopic appendectomy LA always takes longer than traditional appendectomyTA The increased time required to do a LA increasesthe patients exposure to anesthetics which increases therisk of

tubal pregnancies may be the source of pain and notappendicitis If LA is done in these patients the pelvicorgans can be more thoroughly examined and a definitivediagnosis made prior to removal of the appendix Mostsurgeons select either TA or LA based on the individualneeds and circumstances of the patient Insurance plans do cover the costs of appendectomy Fees are charged independently by the hospital and thephysicians Hospital charges include fees for operating and recovery room use diagnostic and laboratory testingas well as the normal hospital room charges Surgicalfees vary from region to region and range between The anesthesiologists fee depends upon the healthof the patient and the length of the operation Preparation Once the diagnosis of appendicitis is made and the decision has been made to perform an appendectomy thepatient undergoes the standard preparation for an operationThis usually takes only one to two hours and includes signing the operative consents patient identification procedures evaluation by the anesthesiologist and moving thepatient to the operating suites of the hospital Occasionallyif the patient has been ill for a prolonged period of time orhas had protracted vomiting a delay of few to several hoursmay be necessary to give the patient fluids and antibiotics Aftercare Recovery from an appendectomy is similar to other operations Patients are

any operation requires a general anesthetic and the abdominal cavity is openedPneumonia and collapse of the small airways atelecta sis often occurs Patients who smoke are at a greater risk for developing these complications Thrombophlebitis or inflammation of the veins is rare but can occur if thepatient requires prolonged bed rest Bleeding can occurbut rarely is a blood transfusion required Adhesions abnormal connections to abdominal organs by thinfibrous tissue is a known complication of any abdominalprocedure such as appendectomy These adhesions canlead to intestinal obstruction which prevents the normalflow of intestinal contents Hernia is a complication of any incision However they are rarely seen after appendectomy because the abdominal wall is very strong in thearea of the standard appendectomy incision The overall complication rate of appendectomy depends upon the status of the appendix at the time it isremoved If the appendix has not ruptured the complicationrate is only about However if the appendix has ruptured the complication rate rises to almost Woundinfections do occur and are more common if the appendicitis was severe far advanced or ruptured An abscess may form in the abdomen as a complication of appendicitis Occasionally an appendix will rupture prior to its removal spilling its contents into the abdominal cavityPeritonitis or a generalized infection in the abdomen will occur Treatment of peritonitis as a result of a ruptured appendix includes removal of what remains of theappendix insertion of drains rubber tubes that promotethe flow of infection inside the abdomen to outside of thebody and antibiotics Fistula formation an abnormalconnection between the cecum and the skin rarelyoccurs It is only seen if the appendix has a broad attachment to the cecum and the appendicitis is far advancedcausing destruction of the cecum itself Normal results Most patients feel better immediately after an opera tion for

Others may require a longer staythree to five days Almost all patients are back to their normal activitieswithin three weeks The mortality rate of appendicitis has dramatically decreased over time Currently the mortality rate is estimated at one to two per cases of appendicitis Death is usually due to peritonitis intra abdominal abscess or severe infection following rupture The complications associated with undiagnosed mis diagnosised or delayed diagnosis of appendectomy arevery significant The diagnosis is of appendicitis is difficult and never certain This has led surgeons to perform anappendectomy any time that they feel appendicitis is thediagnosis Most surgeons feel that in approximately of their patients a normal appendix will be removedRates much lower than this would seem to

in the body but it can become diseasedAppendicitis is a medical emergency and if it is leftuntreated the appendix may rupture and cause a potentially fatal infection Description Appendicitis is the most common abdominal emer gency found in children and young adults One person in develops appendicitis in his or her lifetime The incidence is highest among males aged and amongfemales aged More males than females developappendicitis between puberty and age It is rare in the elderly and in children under the age of two The hallmark symptom of appendicitis is increasing ly severe abdominal pain Since many different condi tions can cause abdominal pain an accurate diagnosis ofappendicitis can be difficult A timely diagnosis is important however because a delay can result in perforationor rupture of the appendix When this happens theinfected contents of the appendix spill into the abdomenpotentially causing a serious infection of the abdomencalled peritonitis Other conditions can have similar symptoms espe cially in women These include pelvic inflammatorydisease ruptured ovarian follicles ruptured ovarian cysts tubal pregnancies and endometriosis Various forms of stomach upset and bowel inflammation mayalso mimic appendicitis The treatment for acute sudden severe appendici tis is an appendectomy surgery to remove the appendix Because of the potential for a lifethreatening rupturedappendix persons suspected of having appendicitis areoften taken to surgery before the diagnosis is certain Causes and symptoms The causes of appendicitis are not well understood but it is believed to occur as a result of one or more ofthese factors an obstruction within the appendix thedevelopment of an ulceration an abnormal change in tissue accompanied by the death of cells within the appen dix and the invasion of bacteria Under these conditions bacteria may multiply with in the appendix The appendix may become swollen andfilled with pus a fluid formed in infected tissue consisting of while blood cells and cellular debris and mayeventually rupture Signs of rupture include the presenceof symptoms for more than hours a fever a high white blood cell count and a fast heart rate Very rarely GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Appendicitis An extracted appendix Photograph by Lester V Bergman Corbis Images Reproduced by permissionGEM to A PM Page the inflammation and symptoms of appendicitis may dis appear but recur again later The distinguishing symptom of appendicitis is pain beginning around or above the navel The pain whichmay be severe or only achy and uncomfortable eventually moves into the right lower corner of the abdomenThere it becomes more steady and more severe andoften increases with movement coughing and so forthThe abdomen often becomes rigid and tender to thetouch Increasing rigidity and tenderness indicates anincreased likelihood of perforation and peritonitis Loss of appetite is very common Nausea and vom iting may occur in about half of the cases and occasion ally there may be constipation or diarrhea The temper ature may be normal or slightly elevated The presence ofa fever may indicate that the appendix has ruptured Diagnosis A careful examination is the best way to diagnose appendicitis It is often difficult even for experiencedphysicians to distinguish the symptoms of appendicitisfrom those of other abdominal disorders Therefore veryspecific questioning and a thorough physical examina tion are crucial The physician should ask questions such as where the pain is centered whether the pain hasshifted and where the pain began The physician shouldpress on the abdomen to judge the location of the painand the degree of tenderness The typical sequence of symptoms is present in about of cases In the other half of cases less typical patterns may be seen especially in pregnant women olderpatients and infants In pregnant women appendicitis iseasily masked by the frequent occurrence of mild abdominal pain and nausea from other causes Elderly patientsmay feel less pain and tenderness than most patientsthereby delaying diagnosis and treatment and leading torupture in of cases Infants and young children oftenhave diarrhea vomiting and fever in addition to pain While laboratory tests cannot establish the diagno sis an increased white cell count may point to appendicitis Urinalysis may help to rule out a urinary tract infec tion that can mimic appendicitis Patients whose symptoms and physical examination are compatible with a diagnosis of appendicitis are usually taken immediately to surgery where a laparotomysurgical exploration of the abdomen is done to confirmthe diagnosis In cases with a questionable diagnosisother tests such as a computed tomography scan CTmay be performed to avoid unnecessary surgery Anultrasound examination of the abdomen may help toidentify an inflamed appendix or other condition thatwould explain the symptoms Abdominal xrays are not of much value except when the appendix has ruptured Often the diagnosis is not certain until an operation is done To avoid a ruptured appendix surgery may be recommended without delay if the symptoms point clearly toappendicitis If the symptoms are not clear surgery may bepostponed until they progress enough to confirm a diagnosis When appendicitis is strongly suspected in a woman of childbearing age a diagnostic laparoscopy an examination of the interior of the abdomen is sometimesrecommended before the appendectomy in order to besure that a gynecological problem such as a rupturedovarian cyst is not causing the pain In this procedure alighted viewing tube is inserted into the abdomenthrough a small incision around the navel A normal appendix is discovered in about of patients who undergo laparotomy because of suspectedappendicitis Sometimes the surgeon will remove a normal appendix as a safeguard against appendicitis in thefuture During the surgery another specific cause for thepain and symptoms of appendicitis is found for about of these patients Treatment The treatment of appendicitis is an immediate appendectomy This may be done by opening theabdomen in the standard open appendectomy techniqueor through laparoscopy In laparoscopy a smaller incision is made through the navel Both methods can successfully accomplish the removal of the appendix It isnot certain that laparoscopy holds any advantage overopen appendectomy When the appendix has rupturedpatients undergoing a laparoscopic appendectomy mayhave to be switched to the open appendectomy procedurefor the successful management of the rupture If a ruptured appendix is left untreated the condition is fatal Prognosis Appendicitis is usually treated successfully by appen dectomy Unless there are complications the patient shouldrecover without further problems The mortality rate incases without complications is less than When anappendix has ruptured or a severe infection has developedthe likelihood is higher for complications with slowerrecovery or death from disease There are higher rates ofperforation and mortality among children and the elderly Prevention Appendicitis is probably

gait walking impairment and improverange of motion Description Origins AK is based on principles of functional neurology anatomy physiology biomechanics and biochemistry aswell as principles from Chinese medicine acupuncture and massage It was developed from traditional kinesiology in by George G Goodheart a chiropractor fromDetroit Michigan He observed that each large musclerelates to a body organ A weakness in a muscle may meanthat there is a problem in the associated organ Goodheartfound that by treating the muscle and making it strongagain he was able to improve the function of the organ aswell For example if a particular nutritional supplementwas given to a patient and the muscle tested strong it wasthe correct supplement for the patient If the muscleremained weak it was not Other methods of treatmentcan be evaluated in a similar manner Goodheart alsofound that painful nodules small bumps may be associated with a weak muscle By deeply massaging the musclehe was able to improve its strength Goodhearts findingsin led to the origin and insertion treatment the firstmethod developed in AK Other diagnostic and therapeuticprocedures were developed for various reflexes describedby other chiropractors and doctors Goodheart incorporated acupuncture meridian therapy into AK after reading thewritings of Felix Mann MD Goodheart considered AK to be a therapeutic tool that incorporates feedback from the body He said thatapplied kinesiology is based on the fact that the bodylanguage never lies He felt that the bodys muscleswere indicators of disharmony Once muscle weaknesshas been ascertained the problem may be solved in avariety of ways If a practitioner approaches the problemcorrectly he believed making the proper and adequatediagnosis and treatment the outcome is satisfactory bothto the doctor and to the patient According to AK each muscle in the body relates to a specific meridian or energy pathway acupuncture GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Applied kinesiologyGEM to A PM Page lines in the body These meridians also relate to organs or glands allowing the muscles to provide informationabout organ or gland function and energy The five areasof diagnosis and therapy for the applied kinesiologist are the nervous system the lymphatic system thevascular blood vessel system the cerebrospinal system and the meridian system The first part of AK is muscle testing which is used to help diagnose what part of the body is functioningabnormally Muscle testing involves putting the bodyinto a position that requires a certain muscle to remaincontracted and then applying pressure against the muscle The testing does not measure strength but is meant toreveal stresses and imbalances in the body through thetension in the muscle The test evaluates the ability of acontrolling system like the nervous system to adapt themuscle to meet the changing pressure of the examinerstest AK practitioners also examine structural factorssuch as posture gait and range of motion Some chiroGEORGE GOODHEART Dr George Goodheart was born in Detroit Michi gan in and became a secondgeneration doctor ofchiropractic He graduated from the National College ofChiropractic in and is recognized as the founderand developer of Applied Kinesiology After he joinedthe US Air Force as an aviation cadet in World War IIhe received a promotion to major at the age of Hewas the youngest ever to attain that rank He served inactive duty from and continued as a member of the Air Force Reserve until the mids Dr Goodheart held numerous positions of distinc tion during his career including director of the NationalChiropractic Mutual Insurance Company and directorfor the International College of Applied KinesiologyUSA He also lectured and taught throughout the United States Japan Europe and Australia and he was theofficial doctor of chiropractic for the Lake Placed WinterOlympic Games in He contributes to a variety oftrade publications on a regular basis In Dr Goodheart received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the International College ofKinesiology Earlier in he was honored with theLeonardo da Vinci Award from the Institute for theAchievement of Human Potential and he was cited forhis research by Logan and Palmer Colleges of Chiropractic He represented the State of Michigan as a delegate to the American Chiropractic Association and wasa fellow at the International College of Chiropractic Heresides with his wife JoAnn in Grosse Pointe WoodsMichigan where he enjoys skiing and tennispractors use AK to help them evaluate the success of spinal adjustment A leg muscle is tested for strength orweakness to determine whether the adjustments made areappropriate According to AK common internal causes of mus cle weakness include dysfunction of nerve supply nerve interference between spine and muscles impairment of lymphatic drainage reduction of blood supply abnormal pressure in cerebral fluid affecting nerveto muscle relationships blockage of an acupuncture meridian imbalance of chemicals dysfunction of organs or glands excesses or deficiencies in nutrition Physiological reactions to chemicals including those associated with nutrition and allergies may also be evaluated using AK The AK protocol for testing chemical compounds is to place the substance on the patientstongue so that he tastes the material and the normalchemical reactions of ingestion begin In some cases thesubstances are inhaled through the nose The AK practitioner then tests the associated muscleorgan pattern todetermine where or if there is a strength or weaknessThe patient does not need to swallow the substance for achange in strength or weakness to be identified David SWalther a diplomate of the International College ofApplied Kinesiology has indicated that it is possiblethat the central nervous system recognizing the compound being ingested relays information to the organsand glands preparing for use of the compound If thecompound is recognized as beneficial the energy patternis immediately enhanced influencing not only the organor gland but also the associated muscle AK has been used as a diagnostic health tool for a variety of

of treatment methods include special diets dietary supplements chiro practic manipulation osteopathic cranial techniques acupuncturemeridian therapies acupressure deep mus cle massage and nervous system coordination procedures For example an AK practitioner might treat asthma by looking for weaknesses in specific lower back andleg muscles that share a connection with the adrenalglands The practitioner will strengthen these musclesand help the adrenal gland produce bronchodilators chemicals that relax or open air passages in the lungs GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Applied kinesiologyGEM to A PM Page The practice of kinesiology requires that it be used in conjunction with other standard diagnostic methods byprofessionals trained in clinical diagnosis Most practitioners of AK are chiropractors but naturopaths medicaldoctors dentists osteopaths nutritionists physical therapists massage therapists podiatrists psychiatrists andnurse practitioners are also involved In of fulltime chiropractors in the United States whoresponded to a survey by the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners NBCE said they used AK in theirpractice Subsequent NBCE surveys indicated that of chiropractors in Canada in Australia and inNew Zealand use AK Most practitioners of AK utilize a holistic approach and evaluate a person from a triadbased health perspective Generally chiropractors approach health and healing from a structural basis medical doctors generallyfrom a chemical basis and psychiatrists and psychologists from a mental or emotional basis Applied kinesiologists attempt to work with all three areas of health andin some cases include a spiritual dimension The use of AK is often included in insurance cover age if the policy covers chiropractor benefits The cost ofthe AK examination is similar to the costs of other chiropractic practices Precautions AK should only by used by trained professionals with the necessary expertise to perform specific andaccurate tests The AK examination should be combinedwith a standard physical diagnosis which often includeslaboratory tests x rays health and dietary history andother special tests An AK examination should enhance astandard diagnosis not replace it The total diagnosticworkup should be used to determine the final diagnosis The use of manual muscle testing to evaluate nutri tion is particularly a problem if it is done by a lay nutrition sales person as a tool to sell hisher product The person should have the educational background to evaluatenutritional needs as well as have a high level of knowledge in the use of proper muscle testing techniques Side effects If AK is performed by a trained practitioner with the appropriate educational background side effects fromthe muscletesting procedures should be minimal Research and general acceptance AK is a tool that is used by many health care pro fessionals and especially by chiropractors A literaturereview published in by researchers from the School of Medicine at the University of North Carolinaat Chapel Hill and the Foundation for Allied Conservative Therapies Research in Chapel Hill stated thatalthough AK appears to be a promising methodologythere is a lack of research results relevant to clinicalpractice and outcomes of AK care They found thislack of results surprising since cost satisfaction utilization and changes in symptoms are the importantresults of clinical practice In addition they determinedthat some studies that were supposed to be an evaluation of AK procedures did not actually use clinicalpractices and principles of AK However from studiesadhering to AK principles and employing standardizedtraining by welltrained practitioners they did statethere was some evidence that AK is an objectively verifiable phenomenon They suggested that future studies of AK should focus on outcomes of care includingsymptoms function costs and safety Only welldesigned studies that account for the individual natureof AK diagnosis and treatment and preserve the properclinical context of AK treatment will be informativeUnderstanding the individual components of theprocess of AK treatment remains important Studiesaddressing validation of isolated AK procedures needto meet the methodological challenges of studyingappropriate subjects that reflects the current recognized practice and understanding of AK

Encephalitis is a serious inflammation of the brain Arbovirus encephalitis is caused by a virus from theArbovirus group The term arbovirus stands for Arthro podborne virus because these viruses are passed to humans by members of the phylum Arthropoda whichincludes insects and spiders Description Of the huge number of arboviruses known to exist about types are responsible for human disease Inaddition to the virus there are usually two other types ofliving creatures involved in the cycle leading to humandisease When large quantities of virus are present in anarthropod often a tick or mosquito the viruses arepassed to a bird or small mammal when the arthropodattempts to feed on the blood of that creature The virusthrives within the new host sometimes causing illnesssometimes not More ticks or mosquitoes are infectedwith the virus when they feed on the hosts blood Eventually a tick or mosquito bites a human and the virus ispassed along Just a few types of arboviruses cycle onlybetween arthropods and humans with no intermediatestop in a bird or small mammal Because the arboviruses require an arthropod to pass them along to humans the most common times of yearfor these illnesses include summer and fall when mosquitoes and ticks are most prevalent Damp environmentsfavor large populations of mosquitoes and thus alsoincrease the risk of arbovirus infections The major causes of arbovirus encephalitis include the members of the viral families alphavirus causingEastern equine encephalitis Western equine encephalitisand Venezuelan equine encephalitis flavivirus responsible for St Louis encephalitis Japanese encephalitis Tickborne encephalitis Murray Valley encephalitisRussian springsummer encephalitis and Powassan andbunyavirus causing California encephalitis In the United States the most important types of arbovirus encephalitis include Western equine encephalitis WEE Eastern equine encephalitis EEE St Louisencephalitis and California encephalitis WEE strikesyoung infants in particular with a chance of death from the illness Of those who survive about sufferpermanent brain damage EEE strikes infants and children with a chance of death and a high rate of permanent brain damage among survivors St Louisencephalitis tends to strike adults older than years ofage and older patients tend to have higher rates of deathand longterm disability from the infection Californiavirus primarily strikes year olds with a lowerdegree of permanent brain damage Causes and symptoms Encephalitis occurs because specific arboviruses have biochemical characteristics which cause them to beparticularly attracted to the cells of the brain and thenerves The virus causes cell death and inflammationwith fever and swelling within the brain and nerves The membranous coverings of the brain and spinal cord themeninges may also become inflamed a condition calledmeningitis The brain is swollen and patches of bleed ing occur throughout the brain and spinal cord Patients with encephalitis suffer from headaches fever nausea and vomiting stiff neck and sleepiness As the disease progresses more severe symptoms develop including tremors confusion seizures coma and paralysis Loss of function occurs when specific nerve areas are damaged andor killed Diagnosis Early in the disease laboratory testing of blood may reveal the presence of the arbovirus The usual techniqueused to verify the presence of arbovirus involves injectingthe patients blood into the brain of a newborn mousethen waiting to see if the mouse develops encephalitisDiagnosis is usually based on the patients symptomshistory of tick or mosquito bites and knowledge that thepatient has been in an area known to harbor the arbovirus Treatment Treatment is mostly supportive meaning it is direct ed at improving the symptoms but does not shorten thecourse of the illness The main concerns of treatmentinvolve lowering fever treating pain avoiding dehydra tion or other chemical imbalances and decreasing swelling in the brain with steroids Prognosis Prognosis depends on the particular type of arbovirus causing disease and on the age and priorhealth status of the patient Death rates range all the wayup to for arbovirus encephalitis and the rates oflifelong effects due to brain damage reach for sometypes of arboviruses Prevention Prevention involves avoiding contact with arthro pods which carry these viruses This means wearing GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Arbovirus encephalitisGEM to A PM Page appropriate insect repellents and dressing

aromatic remedies muchearlier than this The oldest known herbal text ShenNungs Pen Tsao c BC catalogs over botanicals Ayurveda a practice of traditional Indianmedicine that dates back over years also used aromatic herbs for treatment The Romans were wellknown for their use of fra grances They bathed with botanicals and integratedthem into their state and religious rituals So did theGreeks with a growing awareness of the medicinal properties of herbs as well Greek physician and surgeonPedanios Dioscorides whose renown herbal text De Materia Medica AD was the standard textbook for Western medicine for years wrote extensively onthe medicinal value of botanical aromatics The Medica contained detailed information on over plants and separate medicinal uses for them including anentire section on aromatics Written records of herbal distillation are found as early as the first century AD and around AD the noted Arab physician and naturalist Avicenna described the distillation of rose oil from rose petals and the medicinal properties of essential oils in his writings However it wasntuntil when French chemist RenMaurice Gattefosspublished Aromatherapie Les Huiles essentielles hor mones vg tales that aromatherapie or aromatherapy was introduced in Europe as a medical discipline Gattefosswho was employed by a French perfumeur discovered thehealing properties of lavender oil quite by accident whenhe suffered a severe burn while working and used the closest available liquid lavender oil to soak it in In the late th century French physician Jean Valnet used botanical aromatics as a front line treatment forwounded soldiers in World War II He wrote about his use GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AromatherapyGEM to A PM Page of essential oils and their healing and antiseptic properties in his book Aromatherapie traitement des maladies par les essences des plantes which popularized the use of essential oils for medical and psychiatric treatment throughout France Later French biochemist Mauguerite Maurypopularized the cosmetic benefits of essential oils and in Robert Tisserand wrote the first English languagebook on the subject The Art of Aromatherapy which intro duced massage as an adjunct treatment to aromatherapy andsparked its popularity in the United Kingdom In aromatherapy essential oils are carefully selected for their medicinal properties As essential oils areabsorbed into the bloodstream through application to theskin or inhalation their active components trigger certainpharmalogical effects eg pain relief In addition to physical benefits aromatherapy has strong psychological benefits The volatility of an oil orthe speed at which it evaporates in open air is thought tobe linked to the specific psychological effect of an oil

hearts rhythm or heartbeat pattern The heartbeat can be too slow too fasthave extra beats skip a beat or otherwise beat irregularly Description Arrhythmias are deviations from the normal cadence of the heartbeat which cause the heart to pump improperly The normal heartbeat starts in the right atriumwhere the hearts natural pacemaker the sinus nodesends an electrical signal to the center of the heart to theatrioventricular node The atrioventricular node thensends signals into the main pumping chamber to makethe ventricle contract Arrhythmias occur when the heartbeat starts in a part of the heart other than the sinus nodean abnormal rate or rhythm develops in the sinus node ora heart conduction block prevents the electrical signalfrom traveling down the normal pathway More than four million Americans have arrhythmias most of which are harmless Middleaged adults commonly experience arrhythmias As people age the probabilityof experiencing an arrhythmia increases Arrhythmiasoften occur in people who do not have heart disease Inpeople with heart disease it is usually the heart diseasewhich is dangerous not the arrhythmia Arrhythmias oftenoccur during and after heart attacks Some types ofarrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia are serious and even life threatening In the United States arrhythmiasare the primary cause of sudden cardiac death account ing for more than deaths each year Slow heart rates less than beats per minute are called bradycardias while fast heart rates more than beats per minute are called tachycardias Bradycardiacan result in poor circulation of blood and hence a lackof oxygen throughout the body especially the brainTachycardias also can compromise the hearts ability topump effectively because the ventricles do not haveenough time to completely fill Arrhythmias are characterized by their site of origin the atria or the ventricles Supraventricular arrhythmiasoccur in the upper areas of the heart and are less seriousthan ventricular arrhythmias Ventricular fibrillation is the most serious arrhythmia and is fatal unless medicalhelp is immediate Causes and symptoms In many cases the cause of an arrhythmia is unknown Known causes of arrhythmias include heart GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE ArrhythmiasGEM to A PM Page disease stress caffeine tobacco alcohol diet pills and decongestants in cough and cold medicines Symptoms of an arrhythmia include a fast heartbeat pounding or fluttering chest sensations skipping a heartbeat flipflops dizziness faintness shortness of breath and chest pains Diagnosis Examination with a stethoscope electrocardio grams and electrophysiologic studies is used to diagnosearrhythmias Sometimes arrhythmias can be identified bylistening to the patients heart through a stethoscope butsince arrhythmias are not always present they may notoccur during the physical exam An electrocardiogram ECG shows the hearts activity and may reveal a lack of oxygen from poor circulation ischemia Electrodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on the patients chest arms and legsThey send impulses of the hearts activity through anelectrical activity monitor oscilloscope to a recorderthat traces them on paper The test takes about minutes and is performed in a physicians office Anothertype of ECG commonly known as the exercisestress test measures how the heart and blood vessels respond to exertion while the patient is exercising on a treadmillor a stationary bike This test is performed in a physicians office or an exercise laboratory and takes minutes Other types of ECGs include hour ECGmonitoring and transtelephonic monitoring In hourECG Holter monitoring the patient wears a smallportable tape recorder connected to disks on hisher chestthat record the hearts rhythm during daily activitiesTranstelephonic monitoring can identify arrhythmias thatoccur infrequently Similar to Holter monitoring transtelephonic monitoring can continue for days orweeks and it enables patients to send the ECG via telephone to a monitoring station when an arrhythmia is feltor the patient can store the information in the recorderand transmit it later Electrophysiologic studies are invasive procedures performed in a hospital to identify the origin of seriousarrhythmias and responses to various treatments Theyinvolve cardiac catheterization in which catheters tipped with electrodes are passed from a vein in the armor leg through the blood vessels into the heart The electrodes record impulses in the heart highlighting wherethe arrhythmia starts During the procedure physicianscan test the effects of various drugs by provoking anarrhythmia through the electrodes and trying differentdrugs The procedure takes one to three hours duringwhich the patient is awake but mildly sedated Localanesthetic is injected at the catheter insertion sitesTreatment Many arrhythmias do not require any treatment For serious arrhythmias treating the underlying heart diseasesometimes controls the arrhythmia In some cases thearrhythmia itself is treated with drugs electrical shock car dioversion automatic implantable defibrillators artificial pacemakers catheter ablation or surgery Supraventricu lar arrhythmias often can be treated with drug therapy Ventricular arrhythmias are more complex to treat Drug therapy can manage many arrhythmias but finding the right drug and dose requires care and can takesome time Common drugs for suppressing arrhythmiasinclude betablockers calcium channel blockers quini dine digitalis preparations and procainamide Becauseof their potential serious side effects stronger desensitizing drugs are used only to treat lifethreateningarrhythmias All of the drugs used to treat arrhythmiashave possible side effects ranging from mild complications with betablockers and calcium channel blockers tomore serious effects of desensitizing drugs that can paradoxically cause arrhythmias or make them worseResponse to drugs is usually measured by ECG Holtermonitor or electrophysiologic study In emergency situations cardioversion or defibrilla tion the application of an electrical shock to the chest wall is used Cardioversion restores the heart to its normal rhythm It is followed by drug therapy to preventrecurrence of the arrhythmia Artificial pacemakers that send electrical signals to make the heart beat properly can be implanted under theskin during a simple operation Leads from the pacemaker are anchored to the right side of the heart Pacemakersare used to correct bradycardia and are sometimes usedafter surgical or catheter ablation Automatic implantable defibrillators correct life threatening ventricular arrhythmias by recognizing themand then restoring a normal heart rhythm by pacing theheart or giving it an electric shock They are implantedwithin the chest wall without major surgery and storeinformation for future evaluation by physicians Automatic implantable defibrillators have proven to be moreeffective in saving lives than drugs alone They often areused in conjunction with drug therapy Ablation a procedure to alter or remove the heart tissue causing the arrhythmia in order to prevent a recurrence can be performed through a catheter or surgerySupraventricular tachycardia can be treated successfullywith ablation Catheter ablation is performed in acatheterization laboratory with the patient under seda tion A catheter equipped with a device that maps the hearts electrical pathways is inserted into a vein and is GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE ArrhythmiasGEM to A PM Page threaded into the heart Highfrequency radio waves are then used to remove the pathways causing the arrhythmia Surgical ablation is similar in principle but it is performed in a hospital using a cold probe instead of radiowaves to destroy tissue Ablation treatments are usedwhen medications fail Maze surgery treats atrial fibrillation by making multiple incisions through the atrium to allow electricalimpulses to move effectively This is often recommendedfor patients who have not responded to drugs or cardioversion Alternative treatment Since some arrhythmias can be life threatening a conventional medical doctor should always be consultedfirst Acupuncture can correct an insignificant number of atrial fibrillation cases For new minor arrhythmias acupuncture may be effective in up to of casesbut this figure may not differ much from placebo therapyBoth western and Chinese herbal remedies are also usedin the treatment of arrhythmias Since hawthorn Cratae gus laevigata dilates the blood vessels and stimulates the heart muscle it may help to stabilize arrhythmias It isgentle and appropriate for home use unlike foxgloveDigitalis purpurea an herb whose action on the heart is too potent for use without supervision by a qualified practitioner Homeopathic practitioners may prescribe remedies such as Lachesis and aconite or monkshood Aconi tum napellus to treat mild arrhythmias Prognosis

and lodges in another part of theartery it is called an embolism Blockage of an artery in this manner can be the result of a blood clot fat cells oran air bubble When an embolus blocks the flow of blood in an artery the tissues beyond the plug are deprived of normalblood flow and oxygen This can cause severe damageand even death of the tissues involved Emboli can affect any part of the body The most common sites are the legs and feet When the brain isaffected it is called a stroke When the heart is involved it is called a heart attack or myocardial infarction MI Causes and symptoms A common cause of embolus is when an artery whose lining has become thickened or damaged usuallywith age allows cholesterol to build up more easily thannormal on the artery wall If some of the cholesterolbreaks off it forms an embolus Emboli also commonlyform from blood clots in a heart that has been damagedfrom heart attack or when the heart contracts abnormallyfrom arterial fibrillation Other known causes are fat cells that enter the blood after a major bone fracture infected blood cells cancer cells that enter the blood stream and small gas bubbles Symptoms of an embolus can begin suddenly or build slowly over time depending on the amount of blockedblood flow If the embolus is in an arm or leg there will be mus cle pain numbness or tingling pale skin color lower temperature in

usually given through a catheter directly into the affected artery If theembolus was caused by a blood clot medications thatthin the blood will help reduce the risk of anotherembolism A surgeon can remove an embolus by making an incision in the artery above the blockage and using acatheter inserted past the embolus drag it out through theincision If the condition is severe a surgeon may elect to

An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal channel or passage between an artery and a vein Description An arteriovenous fistula is a disruption of the normal blood flow pattern Normally oxygenated blood flows tothe tissue through arteries and capillaries Following therelease of oxygen in the tissues the blood returns to theheart in veins An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal connection of an artery and a vein The blood bypasses the capillaries and tissues and returns to the heart Arterial bloodhas a higher blood pressure than veins and causes swellingof veins involved in a fistula Although both the artery andthe vein retain their normal connections the new openingbetween the two will cause some arterial blood to shuntinto the vein because of the blood pressure difference Causes and symptoms There are two types of arteriovenous fistulas congen ital and acquired A congenital arteriovenous fistula is onethat formed during fetal development It is a birth defectKEY TERMS Congenital Present at the time of birth In congenital fistulas blood vessels of the lower extremity are more frequently involved than other areas of the bodyCongenital fistulas are not common An acquired arteriovenous fistula is one that develops after a person is bornIt usually occurs when an artery and vein that are sidebyside are damaged and the healing process results in thetwo becoming linked After catheterizations arteriovenousfistulas may occur as a complication of the arterial puncture in the leg or arm Fistulas also form without apparentcause In the case of patients on hemodialysis physiciansperform surgery to create a fistula These patients receivemany needle sticks to flush their blood through dialysismachines and for routine blood analysis testing The veinsused may scar and become difficult to use Surgery is usedto connect an artery and vein so that arterial blood pressureand flow rate widens the vein and decreases the chance ofblood clots forming inside the vein The main symptoms of arteriovenous fistulas near the surface of the skin are bulging and discolored veinsIn some cases the bulging veins can be mistaken forvaricose veins Other fistulas can cause more serious problems depending on their location and the blood vessels involved Diagnosis Using a stethoscope a physician can detect the sound of a pulse in the affected vein bruit The sound isa

They donot possess the capillary very fine blood vessels bedwhich normally exists in the common area where thearteries and veins lie in close proximity arteryveininterface An arteriovenous malformation A VM mayhemorrhage or bleed leading to serious complicationsthat can be lifethreatening Description A VMs represent an abnormal interface between arteries and veins Normally arteries carry oxygenatedblood to the bodys tissues through progressively smallerblood vessels The smallest are capillaries which form aweb of blood vessels the capillary bed through thebodys tissues The arterial blood moves through tissuesby these tiny pathways exchanging its load of oxygenand nutrients for carbon dioxide and other waste productsproduced by the body cells cellular wastes The blood iscarried away by progressively larger blood vessels theveins A VMs lack a capillary bed and arterial blood ismoved shunted directly from the arteries into the veins A VMs can occur anywhere in the body and have been found in the arms hands legs feet lungs heart liver andkidneys However of these malformations are located in the brain brainstem and spinal cord Owing to thepossibility of hemorrhaging such A VMs carry the risk ofstroke paralysis and the loss of speech memory or vision An A VM that hemorrhages can be fatal Approximately three of every people have a cerebral A VM and roughly of them will experience some bleeding from the abnormal blood vessels atsome point The annual risk of an A VM bleeding is estimated at about After age the risk of bleedingdecreases Preexisting high blood pressure or intensephysical activity do not seem to be associated with A VMhemorrhage but pregnancy and labor could cause a rup ture or breaking open of a blood vessel An A VM hemorrhage is not as dangerous as an aneurysmal rupture Ananeurysm is a swollen blood filled vessel where thepressure of the blood causes the wall to bulge outwardThere is an approximate fatality rate associated withA VM hemorrhage compared to a fatality rate forruptured aneurysms Although A VMs are congenital defects meaning a person is born with them they are rarely discoveredbefore age A genetic link has been proposed for someA VMs but studies are only suggestive not positive Themajority of A VMs are discovered in people age Medical researchers estimate that the malformations arecreated during days of fetal development A second theory suggests that A VMs are primitive structuresthat are left over from the period when fetal blood circulating systems began to develop However they form A VMs have blood vessels that are abnormally fragile The arteries that feed into themalformation are unusually swollen and thin walledThey lack the usual amount of smooth muscle tissue andelastin a fibrous connective tissue These blood vesselscommonly accumulate deposits of calcium salts andhyalin The venous part of the malformation receivesblood directly from the artery Without the interveningcapillary bed the veins receive blood at a higher pressurethan they were designed to handle This part of the malformation is also swollen dilated and thin walled Thereis a measurable risk of an aneurysm forming near anA VM increasing the threat of hemorrhage brain damage and death Approximately of A VMs are accompanied by saccular aneurysms a type of aneurysmthat looks like a small sac attached to the outer wall ofthe blood vessel GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Arteriovenous malformations Arteriovenous malformations Custom Medical Stock Photo Reproduced by permissionGEM to A PM Page Although the malformation itself lacks capillaries there is often an abnormal proliferation of capillariesnext to the defect These blood vessels feed into the malformation causing it to grow larger in some cases As theA VM receives more blood through this steal adjacentbrain tissue does not receive enough These areas showabnormal nerve cell growth cell death and deposits ofcalcium in that area calcification Nerve cells within themalformation may demonstrate abnormal growth and arebelieved to be nonfunctional Causes and symptoms Most people do not realize that they have an A VM unless it hemorrhages enough to produce symptomsSmall A VMs are more likely to hemorrhage If a hemorrhage occurs it produces a sudden severe headache The headache may be focused in one specific area or itmay be more general It can be mistaken for a migrainein some cases The headache is accompanied by othersymptoms such as vomiting a stiff neck sleepinesslethargy confusion irritability or weakness anywhere inthe body Seizures occur in about a quarter of A VMcases A person may experience decreased double orblurred vision Hemorrhaging from an A VM is generallyless dangerous than hemorrhaging from an aneurysmwith a survival rate of Other symptoms occur less frequently but some times appear alongside major symptoms such as the sudden severe headache Additional warning signs of ableeding A VM are impaired speech or smell fainting facial paralysis a drooping eyelid dizziness and ringing or buzzing in the ears Although large A VMs are less likely to hemorrhage they can induce symptoms based on their mass aloneLarge A VMs exert pressure against brain tissue causeabnormal development in the surrounding brain tissueand slow down or block blood flow Hydrocephalus a swelling of brain tissue caused by accumulated fluidsmay develop The warning signs associated with a largenonbleeding A VM are similar to the symptoms of asmall malformation that is bleeding Unexplainedheadaches seizures dizziness and neurological symptoms such as sensory changes are signals that demandmedical attention Diagnosis Based on the clinical symptoms such as severe headache and neurological problems and after a complete neurologic exam a computed tomography scan CT of the head will be done In some cases a whooshing sound from arteries in the neck or over the eye or jawcalled a bruit can be heard with a stethoscope The CTscan will reveal whether there has been bleeding in the brain and can identify A VMs larger than inch cmMagnetic resonance imaging MRI is also used to identify an A VM A lumbar puncture or spinal tap mayfollow the MRI or CT scan A lumbar puncture involvesremoving a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid from thelower part of the spine Blood cells or blood breakdownproducts in the cerebrospinal fluid indicate bleeding To pinpoint where the blood is coming from a cere bral angiography is done This procedure uses x rays to map out the blood vessels in the brain including the vessels that feed into the malformation The informationgained from angiography complements the MRI andhelps distinguish the precise location of the A VM Treatment Neurosurgeons consider several factors before deciding on a treatment option There is some debateover whether or not to treat A VMs that have not ruptured and are not causing any symptoms The risks andbenefits of proceeding with treatment need to be measured on an individual basis taking into account factorssuch as the persons age and general health as well asthe A VMs size and location Several treatment optionsare available both for symptomatic or asymptomaticA VMs These treatment options may be used alone or incombination Surgery Removing the A VM is the surest way of preventing it from causing future problems Both small and largeA VMs can be handled in surgery Surgery is recommended for superficial A VMs but may be too dangerous fordeep or very large A VMs Unless it is an emergency situation an A VM that has hemorrhaged is treated conservatively for several weeks Conservative treatment consistsof managing the immediate symptoms and allowing thepatients condition to stabilize Surgery requires generalanesthesia and a longer period of recuperation than anyother treatment option Radiation Radiation is particularly useful to treat small under in malformations that are deep within the brain Ionizing radiation is directed at the malformation destroyingthe A VM without damaging the surrounding tissue Radiation treatment is accomplished in a single session and itis not necessary to open the skull However success canonly be measured over the course of the following twoyears A year after the procedure of treatedA VMs are completely blocked two years after radiationtreatment the percentage

opening theskull to expose the brain and can be used to treat deepA VMs Using xray images as a guide a catheter isthreaded through the artery in the thigh femoral artery tothe affected area The patient remains awake during theprocedure and medications can be administered to prevent discomfort The blood vessel leading into the A VMis assessed for its importance to the rest of the brainbefore a balloon or other blocking agent is inserted via thecatheter The block chokes off the blood supply to themalformation There may be a mild headache or nauseaassociated with the procedure but patients may resumenormal activities after leaving the hospital At least two tothree embolization procedures are usually necessary atintervals of two to six weeks At least a threeday hospitalstay is associated with each embolization Prognosis Approximately of A VM cases are fatal Seizures and neurological changes may be permanent in another cases of A VM rupture If an A VM bleeds once itis about likely to bleed again in the next year Astime passes from the initial hemorrhage the risk for further bleeding drops to about If the A VM has notbled it is possible but not guaranteed that it never

complication with their physician Patients who havea known allergy to shellfish are more likely to be allergicto iodine contrast Description Arthrograpy may be referred to as joint radiography or x rays of the joint The term arthrogram may be usedinterchangeably with arthrography The joint area will becleaned and a local anesthetic will be injected into the tissues around the joint to reduce pain Next if fluids are present in the joint the physician may suction them out aspirate with a needle These fluids may be sent to a laboratory for further study Contrast agents are then injected intothe joint through the same location by attaching the aspirating needle to a syringe containing the contrast mediumThe purpose of contrast agents in xray procedures is tohelp highlight details of areas under study by making themopaque Agents for arthrography are generally air andwatersoluble dyes the most common containing iodineAir and iodine may be used together or independentlyAfter the contrast agent is administered the site of injection will be sealed and the patient may be asked to movethe joint around to distribute the contrast Before the contrast medium can be absorbed by the joint itself several films will be quickly taken under theguidance of the fluoroscope The patient will be asked tomove the joint into a series of positions keeping still between positioning Sometimes the patient will experiencesome tingling or discomfort during the procedure which isnormal and due to the contrast Following fluoroscopictracking of the contrast standard x rays of the area may alsobe taken The entire procedure will last about one hour Preparation It is important to discuss any known sensitivity to local anesthetics or iodine prior to this procedure Aphysician should explain the procedure and the risksassociated with contrast agents and ask the patient to signan informed consent If iodine contrast will be administered the patient may be instructed not to eat before theexam The timeframe of fasting may extend from only minutes prior to the exam up to the night beforeThere is no other preparation necessary Aftercare The affected joint should be rested for approximate ly hours following the procedure The joint may bewrapped in an elastic bandage and the patient shouldreceive instructions on the care and changing of the bandage Noises in the joint such as cracking or clicking arenormal for a few days following arthrography Thesenoises are the result of liquid in the joints Swelling mayalso occur and can be treated with application of ice orcold packs A mild pain

airportbaggage security stations Radiologist A medical doctor specially trained in radiology x ray interpretation and its use in thediagnosis of diseases and injuries X ray A form of electromagnetic radiation with shorter wavelengths than normal light X rays canpenetrate most structuresPurpose The goal of arthroplasty is to restore the function of a stiffened joint and relieve pain Two types of arthroplasticsurgery exist Joint resection involves removing a portionof the bone from a stiffened joint creating a gap betweenthe bone and the socket to improve the range of motionScar tissue eventually fills the gap Pain is relieved andmotion is restored but the joint is less stable Interpositional reconstruction is surgery to reshape the joint and add a prosthetic disk between the two bonesforming the joint The prosthesis can be made of plasticand metal or from body tissue such as fascia and skinWhen interpositional reconstruction fails total joint replacement may be necessary Joint replacement is also called total joint arthroplasty In recent years joint replacement has become the oper ation of choice for most knee and hip problems Elbowshoulder ankle and finger joints are more likely to be treated with joint resection or interpositional reconstruction Arthroplasty is performed on people suffering from severe pain and disabling joint stiffness that result fromosteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis Joint resection rather than joint replacement is more likely to be performed on people with rheumatoid arthritis especiallywhen the elbow joint is involved Total joint replacementis usually reserved for people over the age of Precautions If both the bone and socket of a joint are damaged joint replacement is usually the preferred treatment Description Arthroplasty is performed under general or regional anesthesia in a hospital by an orthopedic surgeon Certain medical centers specialize in joint surgery and tendto have higher success rates than less specialized centers In joint resection the surgeon makes an incision at the joint then carefully removes minimum amount ofbone necessary to allow free motion The more bone thatremains the more stable the joint Ligament attachmentsare preserved as much as possible In interpositionalreconstruction both bones of the joint are reshaped anda disk of material is placed between the bones to preventtheir rubbing together Length of hospital stay dependson which joint is treated but is normally only a few days Preparation Prior to arthroplasty all the standard preoperative blood and urine tests are performed The patient meets GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE ArthroplastyGEM to A PM Page with the anesthesiologist to discuss any special condi tions that affect the administration of anesthesia

such asMRIs or CTs dont provide a definitive diagnosis Precautions Diagnostic arthroscopic surgery should not be per formed unless conservative treatment does not fix theproblem Description In arthroscopic surgery an orthopedic surgeon uses an arthroscope a fiberoptic instrument to see the insideof a joint After making an incision about the size of abuttonhole in the patients skin a sterile sodium chloridesolution is injected to distend the joint The arthroscopean instrument the size of a pencil is then inserted into thejoint The arthroscope has a lens and a lighting systemthrough which the structures inside the joint are transmitted to a miniature television camera attached to the endof the arthroscope The surgeon uses irrigation and suction to remove blood and debris from the joint beforeexamining it Other incisions may be made in order tosee other parts of the joint or to insert additional instruments Looking at the interior of the joint on the television screen the surgeon can then determine the amountor type of injury and if necessary take a biopsy specimen or repair or correct the problem Arthroscopicsurgery can be used to remove floating bits of cartilageand treat minor tears and other disorders When the procedure is finished the arthroscope is removed and thejoint is irrigated The site of the incision is bandaged Arthroscopic surgery is used to diagnose and treat joint problems most commonly in the knee but also in theshoulder elbow ankle wrist and hip Some of the mostcommon joint problems seen with an arthroscope are inflammation in the knee shoulder elbow

structures The procedure is performed byinserting a specifically designed illuminated device intothe joint through a small incision This instrument iscalled an arthroscope The procedure of arthroscopy isprimarily associated with the process of diagnosis However when actual repair is performed the procedure iscalled arthroscopic surgery Purpose Arthroscopy is used primarily by doctors who special ize in treating disorders of the bones and related structuresorthopedics to help diagnose joint problems Oncedescribed as essential for those who primarily care for athletic injuries arthroscopy is now a technique commonlyused by orthopedic surgeons for the treatment of patients ofall ages This procedure is most commonly used to diagnoseknee and shoulder problems although the elbow hip wristand

patient is admittedjust before surgery A few hours following the procedurethe patient is allowed to return home although usuallysomeone else must drive Depending on the type of anesthesia used the patient may be told not to eat for severalhours before arriving Before the procedure the anesthesiologist will ask if the patient has any known allergies to local or general anesthetics Airway

be available The patients cardiacstatus should always be monitored in the event that anycardiac abnormalities arise during the arthroscopy Description The arthroscope is an instrument used to look direct ly into the joint It contains magnifying lenses and glasscoated fibers that send concentrated light into the joint Acamera attached to the arthroscope allows the surgeon tosee a clear image of the joint This image is then transferred to a monitor located in the operating room at thetime of the arthroscopy This video technology is alsoimportant for documentation of the arthroscopic procedure For example if the surgeon decides after the arthroscopic examination that a conventional approach to surgically expose or open the joint arthrotomy must beused a good photographic record will be useful when thesurgeon returns to execute the final surgical planThe procedure requires the surgeon to make several small incisions portals through the skins surface intothe joint Through one or two of the portals a largeboreneedle called a cannula is attached to tubing and insertedinto the joint The joint is inflated with a sterile salinesolution to expand the joint and ensure clear arthroscopicviewing Often following a recent traumatic injury to ajoint the joints natural fluid may be cloudy making interior viewing of the joint difficult In this condition a constant flow of the saline solution is necessary This inflowof saline solution may be through the cannula with theoutflow through the arthroscope or the positions may bereversed The arthroscope is placed through one of theportals to view and evaluate the condition of the joint Preparation Before an arthroscopy can take place the surgeon completes a thorough medical history and evaluationImportant for the accuracy of

referred to a joint from another area of the body Anatomical models and pictures are useful aids to explain to the patient the proposed arthroscopyand what the surgeon may be looking at specifically Proper draping of the body part is important to pre vent contamination from instruments used in arthroscopysuch as the camera light cords and inflow and outflowdrains placed in the portals Draping packs used inarthroscopy include disposable paper gowns and drapeswith adhesive backing The surgeon may also place atourniquet above the joint to temporarily block blood flowto the area during the arthroscopic exam General or local anesthesia may be used during arthroscopy Local anesthesia is usually used because itreduces the risk of lung and heart complications andallows the patient to go home sooner The local anesthetic may be injected in small amounts in multiple locationsin skin and joint tissues in a process called infiltration Inother cases the anesthetic is injected into the spinal cordor a main nerve supplying the area This process is calleda block and it blocks all sensation below the maintrunk of the nerve For example a femoral block anesthetizes the leg from the thigh down its name comesfrom femur the thighbone Most patients are comfortable once the skin muscles and other tissues around thejoint are numbed by the anesthetic however somepatients are also given a sedative if they express anxiety about the procedure Its important for the patient toremain still during the arthroscopic examination General anesthesia in which the patient becomes unconcious may be used if the procedure may be unusually complicated or painful For example people whohave relatively tight joints may be candidates for general anesthesia because the procedure may take longerand cause more discomfort Aftercare The portals are closed by small tape strips or stitches and covered with dressings and a bandage The patientspends a short amount of time in the recovery room afterarthroscopy Most patients can go home after about anhour in the recovery room Pain medication may be prescribed for a short period however many patients findvarious overthecounter pain relievers sufficient Following the surgical procedure the patient needs to be aware of the signs of infection which include redness warmth excessive pain and swelling The risk ofinfection increases if the incisions become wet too earlyfollowing surgery Because of this it is good practice to cover the joint with plastic for example a plastic bagwhile showering after arthroscopy The use of crutches is commonplace after arthro scopy with progression to independent walking on an astolerated basis by the patient Generally a rehabilitation program supervised by a physical therapist follows shortly after the arthroscopy to help the patient regain mobilityand strength of the affected joint and limb Risks The incidence of complications is low compared to the high number of arthroscopic procedures

individual group or family psychotherapy talk therapy While a therapist may provide criticalguidance for these activities a key feature of effective arttherapy is that the patientartist not the therapist directsthe interpretation of the artwork Art therapy can be a particularly useful treatment tool for children who frequently have limited languageskills By drawing or using other visual means to expresstroublesome feelings younger patients can begin toaddress these issues even if they cannot identify or labelthese emotions with words Art therapy is also valuable for adolescents and adults who are unable or unwilling totalk about thoughts and feelings Beyond its use in mental health treatment art thera py is also used with traditional medicine to treat organicdiseases and conditions The connection between mentaland physical health is well documented and art therapycan promote healing by relieving stress and allowing thepatient to develop coping skills Art therapy has traditionally centered on visual mediums like paintings sculptures and drawings Somemental healthcare providers have now broadened the definition to include music film dance writing and othertypes of artistic expression Art therapy is often one part of a psychiatric inpatient or outpatient treatment program and can take place inindividual or group therapy sessions Group art therapy sessions often take place in hospital clinic shelter andcommunity program settings These group therapy sessions can have the added benefits of positive social interaction empathy and support from peers The clientartistcan learn that others have similar concerns and issues Preparations Before starting art therapy the therapist may have an introductory session with the clientartist to discuss arttherapy techniques and give the client the opportunity toask questions about the process The clientartists comfortwith the artistic process is critical to successful art therapy The therapist ensures that appropriate materials and space are available for the clientartist as well as an adequate amount of time for the session If the individualartist is exploring art as therapy without the guidance of atrained therapist adequate materials space and time arestill important factors in a successful creative experience The supplies used in art therapy are limited only by the artists andor therapists imagination Some of thematerials often used include paper canvas poster boardassorted paints inks markers pencils charcoals chalksfabrics string adhesives clay wood glazes wire bendable metals and natural items like shells leaves etcProviding artists with a variety of materials in assortedcolors and textures can enhance their interest in theprocess and may result in a richer more diverse exploration of their emotions in the resulting artwork Appropriate tools such as scissors brushes erasers easels supply trays glue guns smocks or aprons and cleaningmaterials are also essential An appropriate workspace should be available for the creation of art Ideally this should be a bright quietcomfortable place with large tables counters or other GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Art therapyGEM to A PM Page suitable surfaces The space can be as simple as a kitchen or office table or as fancy as a specialized artists studio The artist should have adequate time to become comfortable with and explore the creative process Thisis especially true for people who do not consider themselves artists and may be uncomfortable with the concept If performed in a therapy group or oneonone session the art therapist should be available to answer general questions about materials andor the creativeprocess However the therapist should be careful not toinfluence the creation or interpretation of the work Precautions Art materials and techniques should match the age and ability of the client People with impairments suchas traumatic brain injury or an organic neurological condition may have difficulties with the selfdiscovery portion of the art therapy process depending on their level offunctioning However they may still benefit from arttherapy through the sensory stimulation it provides andthe pleasure they get from artistic creation While art is accessible to all with or without a ther apist to guide the process it may be difficult to tap thefull potential of the interpretive part of art therapy without a therapist to guide the process When art therapy ischosen as a therapeutic tool to cope with a physical condition it should be treated as a supplemental therapy andnot as a substitute for conventional medical treatments Research and general acceptance A wide body of literature supports the use of art therapy in a mental health capacity And as the

Nearly of those who died lived in California or GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AsbestosisGEM to A PM Page New Jersey and most of them had worked in the con struction or shipbuilding trades Causes and symptoms Occupational exposure is the most common cause of asbestosis but the condition also strikes people whoinhale asbestos fiber or who are exposed to waste products from plants near their homes Family members candevelop the disease as a result of inhaling particles ofasbestos dust that cling to workers clothes It is rare for asbestosis to develop in anyone who hasnt been exposed to large amounts of asbestos on aregular basis for at least years Symptoms of the disease do not usually appear until years after initialexposure to asbestos The first symptom of asbestosis is usually shortness of breath following exercise or other physical activity The early stages of the disease are also characterized by adry cough and a generalized feeling of illness As the disease progresses and lung damage increas es shortness of breath occurs even when the patient is atrest Recurrent respiratory infections and coughing upblood are common So is swelling of the feet ankles orhands Other symptoms of advanced asbestosis includechest pain hoarseness and restless sleep Patients who have asbestosis often have clubbed widened and thickened fingers Other potential complications includeheart failure collapsed deflated lung and pleurisy inflammation of the membrane that protects the lung Diagnosis Screening of atrisk workers can reveal lung inflamma tion and lesions characteristic of asbestosis Patients medical histories can identify occupations hobbies or other sit uations likely to involve exposure to asbestos fibers X rays can show shadows or spots on the lungs or an indistinct or shaggy outline of the heart that suggests thepresence of asbestosis Blood tests are used to measureconcentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide Pulmonaryfunction tests can be used to assess a

important factors in the production of ascites due to chronic liver disease are Low levels of albumin in the blood that cause a change in the pressure necessary to prevent fluid exchangeosmotic pressure This change in pressure allows fluidto seep out of the blood vessels An increase in the pressure within the branches of the portal vein that run through liver portal hypertension Portal hypertension is caused by the scarring thatoccurs in cirrhosis Blood that cannot flow through theliver because of the increased pressure leaks into theabdomen and causes ascites Other conditions that

Aspartate aminotransferase AST is also knownas serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase SGOT Purpose The determination of AST levels aids primarily in the diagnosis of liver disease In the past the AST testwas used to diagnose heart attack myocardial infarc tion or MI but more accurate blood tests have largelyreplaced it for cardiac purposes Description AST is determined by analysis of a blood sample usually from taken from a venipuncture site at the bendof the elbow GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Aspartate aminotransferase testGEM to A PM Page AST is found in the heart liver skeletal muscle kidney pancreas spleen lung red blood cells and braintissue When disease or injury affects these tissues thecells are destroyed and AST is released into the bloodstream The amount of AST is directly related to thenumber of cells affected by the disease or injury but thelevel of elevation depends on the length of time that theblood is tested after the injury Serum AST levelsbecome elevated eight hours after cell injury peak at hours and return to normal in three to seven days Ifthe cellular injury is chronic ongoing AST levels willremain elevated One of the most important uses for AST

normal Acute extrahepatic outside theliver obstruction eg gallstone produces AST levelsthat can quickly rise to times normal and then rapidly fall In cases of cirrhosis the AST level is related to the amount of active inflammation of the liver Determination of AST also assists in early recognition of toxichepatitis that results from exposure to drugs toxic to theliver like acetaminophen and cholesterol lowering medications Other disorders or diseases in which the AST deter mination can be valuable include acute pancreatitis muscle disease trauma severe burn and infectious mononucleosis

Aspergillosis Definition Aspergillosis refers to several forms of disease caused by a fungus in the genus Aspergillus Aspergillo sis fungal infections can occur in the ear canal eyesnose sinus cavities and lungs In some individuals theinfection can even invade bone and the membranes thatenclose the brain and spinal cord meningitis Description Aspergillosis is primarily an infection of the lungs caused by the inhalation of airborne spores of the fungusAspergillus Spores are the small particles that most fungi use to reproduce Although virtually everyone isexposed to this fungus in their daily environment itrarely causes disease When Aspergillus does cause dis ease however it usually occurs in those individuals withweakened immune systems immunocompromised orwho have a history of respiratory ailments Because itdoes not present distinctive symptoms aspergillosis isgenerally thought to be underdiagnosed and underreported Furthermore many patients with the more severeforms of aspergillosis tend to have multiple complexhealth problems such as AIDS or a blood disorder like leukemia which can further complicate diagnosis andtreatment Once considered particularly rare the incidence of reported aspergillosis has risen somewhat with the development of more sophisticated methods of diagnosis andadvances made in other areas of medicine such as withthe increased use of certain chemotherapeutic and corticosteroid drugs that are extremely useful in treating various types of cancer but that decrease the individuals immune response making them more susceptible toother diseases like aspergillosis Our advanced ability to perform tissue and organ transplants has also increased the number of people vulnerable to fungal infections Transplant recipients particularly those receiving bone marrow or heart transplantsare highly susceptible to Aspergillus which may be cir culating in the hospital air Aspergillosis can be a serious potentially deadly threat for two primary reasons Aspergillosis usually occurs in those individuals who are already ill or have weakened immune systems suchas patients who have undergone chemotherapy for cancer None of the currently available antifungal drugs are reliably effective against Aspergillus Causes and symptoms Aspergillus is a fungus that is found almost everywhere but particularly in soil water decaying vegetation andstored grain The fungus has also been cultured from ventilation systems and may be stirred up during building renovations The species most commonly identified in patients withconfirmed disease are A fumigatus and A flavus Airborne Aspergillus spores enter the body primarily through inhalation but can also lodge in the ear or eyeNormally functioning immune systems are generally ableto cope without consequent development of aspergillosis It is important to make distinctions between the vari ous forms of aspergillosis as the treatment and prognosisvaries considerably among types Aspergillosis as a diagnosis refers to three general forms Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis ABPA is seen in patients with longstanding asthma particular ly in patients taking oral corticosteroids for a long period of time This is usually the least serious andmost treatable form Aspergilloma refers to the mass formed when fungal spores settle into or colonize areas of the lung that havebeen pitted and scarred as a result of tuberculosis or prior pneumonia There are several available treatments although the success rate varies with each treatment Invasive fungal infection refers to rare cases in which the fungus spreads throughout the body via the bloodstream and invades other organ systems Once established invasive fungal infections are extremely difficultto cure and as a result the associated death rate is extremely high Aspergillus infection of the ear called otomycosis can produce itching and a discharge sometimes noticed as a spot on the pillow Fungal infection of the cornea ofthe eye in a susceptible person can result in blindness ifnot diagnosed and treated promptly Diagnosis Aspergillosis can be quite difficult to diagnose because the symptoms such as coughing and wheezing if present at all are common to many respiratory disorders Furthermore blood and sputum cultures are notvery helpful The presence of Aspergillus is so common even in asthmatics that a positive culture alone is insufficient for a diagnosis Other potentially more usefulscreening tools include examining the sample obtainedafter repeatedly washing the bronchial tubes of the lungwith water bronchial lavage but examining a tissuesample biopsy is the most reliable diagnostic toolResearchers are currently attempting to develop a practi GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AspergillosisGEM to A PM Page cal specific and rapid blood test that would confirm Aspergillus infection Signs of ABPA include a worsening of bronchial asthma accompanied by a lowgrade fever Brown flecks or clumps may be seen in the sputum Pulmonary function tests may show decreased blood flow suggesting anobstruction within the lungs Elevated blood levels of anantibody produced in response to Aspergillus and of cer tain immune system cells may indicate a specific allergictype immune system response A fungal mass aspergilloma in the lung usually does not produce clear symptoms and is generally diagnosed when seen on chest x rays However or moreof patients spit up blood from the lungs hemoptysis at least once and this may become repetitive and seriousHemoptysis then is another indication that the patientmay be suffering from an aspergilloma In patients with lowered immune systems who are at risk for developing invasive aspergillosis the physicianmay use a combination of blood culture with visual diag nostic techniques such as computed tomography scans CT and radiography to arrive at a likely diagnosis Treatment The treatment method selected depends on the form of aspergillosis ABPA can usually be treated with manyof the same drugs used to treat asthma such as systemic steroids Longterm therapy may be required however toprevent recurrence Antifungal agents are not recommended in the treatment of ABPA In cases of aspergilloma it may become necessary to surgically remove orreduce the size of a fungal mass especially if the patientcontinues to spit up blood In aspergillosis cases affectingthe nose and nasal sinuses surgery may also be required In nonABPA cases the use of antifungal drugs may be indicated In such cases amphotericin B Fungizoneis the firstline therapy The prescribed dose will dependon the patients condition but usually begins with a smalltest dose and then escalates Less than onethird ofpatients are likely to respond to amphotericin B and itsside effects often limit its use For patients who do notrespond to oral amphotericin B another option is a different formulation of the same drug called liposomalamphotericin B For patients who fail to respond or who cannot toler ate amphotericin B another drug called itraconazoleSporanox given mg daily has also beenapproved Treatment generally lasts about months Giving itraconazole can produce adverse reactions if prescribed in combination with certain other drugs byincreasing the concentrations of both drugs in the bloodand creating a potentially lifethreatening situation Evenantacids can significantly affect itraconazole levels As a result drug levels must be continually monitored toensure that absorption is occurring at acceptable levels Two other methods of treatment are being studied direct instillation of an antifungal agent into the lungsand administration of antifungals using a nebulizerInstilling or injecting amphotericin B or itraconazoledirectly into the lung cavity or into the fungal ballaspergilloma itself has been helpful in stoppingepisodes of hemoptysis but not in preventing futurerecurrences Furthermore many patients with aspergillomas are poor risks for surgery because their lung function is already compromised As a result instillation of afungal agent should only be considered in those whohave significant hempotysis A popular method of treating some respiratory dis orders is to add a liquid drug to another carrier liquid andaerosolize or produce a fine mist that can be inhaled intothe lungs through a device called a nebulizer Howeverthis has not yet been shown to improve the patients condition in cases of aspergillosis possibly because the drugis not reaching the aspergilloma At this point preventative therapy for aspergillosis is not suggested for susceptible individuals primarilybecause overuse of the drugs used to fight fungal infections may lead to the development of

Electronic Illustrators GroupGEM to A PM Page aspergillosis against which current antifungal drugs are no longer effective Prognosis The likelihood of recovery from aspergillosis depends on any underlying medical conditions the patients general health and the specific type of aspergillosis If the problem is based on an allergic response as in ABPA thepatient will likely respond well to systemic steroids Patients who require lung surgery especially those who have problems with coughing up blood have a mortality rate of about and complications or recurrencemay result in a higher overall death rate However by treating aspergilloma with other nonsurgical methods that riskrises to making surgery a better option in some cases Unfortunately the prognosis for the most serious form invasive aspergillosis is quite poor largely becausethese patients have little resilience due to their underlyingdisorders Death rates have ranged from about insome studies to as high as for bonemarrow recipientsand patients with AIDS The course of the illness can berapid resulting in death within a few months of diagnosis Prevention Fungal infection by Aspergillus presents a major challenge particularly in the patient with a suppressedimmune system immunocompromised Hospitals andgovernment health agencies continually seek ways tominimize exposure for hospitalized patients Practicalsuggestions are minimal but include moving leaf pilesaway from the house Unfortunately overall avoidance ofthis fungus is all but impossible because it is present inthe environment virtually everywhere Research effortsare being directed at enhancing patients resistance toAspergillus rather than trying to eliminate exposure to the fungus Given the growing number of people withimmune

gasps for air Obstruction to air flow either stops sponta neously or responds to a wide range of treatments butcontinuing inflammation makes the airways hyperresponsive to stimuli such as cold air exercise dust mites pollutants in the air and even stress and anxiety Description About million Americans have asthma and the number seems to be increasing Between therate actually rose by Not only is asthma becomingmore frequent but it also is a more severe disease thanbefore despite modern drug treatments In the same year period the death rate from asthma in the United States increased by The changes that take place in the lungs of asth matic persons makes the airways the breathing tubesor bronchi and the smaller bronchioles hyperreactive to many different types of stimuli that dont affecthealthy lungs In an asthma attack the muscle tissue inthe walls of bronchi go into spasm and the cells liningthe airways swell and secrete mucus into the air spacesBoth these actions cause the bronchi to become narrowed bronchoconstriction As a result an asthmaticperson has to make a much greater effort to breathe inair and to expel it Cells in the bronchial walls called mast cells release certain substances that cause the bronchial muscle to contract and stimulate mucus formation Thesesubstances which include histamine and a group ofchemicals called leukotrienes also bring white bloodcells into the area which is a key part of the inflammatory response Many patients with asthma are prone toreact to such foreign substances as pollen house dustmites or animal dander these are called allergens Onthe other hand asthma affects many patients who are notallergic in this way Asthma usually begins in childhood or adolescence but it also may first appear during adult years While thesymptoms may be similar certain important aspects ofasthma are different in children and adults Childonset asthma When asthma does begin in childhood it often does so in a child who is likely for genetic reasons to becomesensitized to common allergens in the environmentatopic person When these children are exposed tohousedust mites animal proteins fungi or other potential allergens they produce a type of antibody that isintended to engulf and destroy the foreign materials Thishas the effect of making the airway cells sensitive to particular materials Further exposure can lead rapidly to anasthmatic response This condition of atopy is present in at least onethird and as many as half of the general population When an infant or young child wheezes duringviral infections the presence of allergy in the child itselfor a close relative is a clue that asthma may well continue throughout childhood Adultonset asthma Allergenic materials may also play a role when adults become asthmatic Asthma can actually start atany age and in a wide variety of situations Many adultswho are not allergic do have such conditions as sinusitis or nasal polyps or they may be sensitive to aspirin and related drugs Another major source of adult asthma isexposure at work to animal products certain forms ofplastic wood dust or metals Causes and symptoms In most cases asthma is caused by inhaling an aller gen that sets off the chain of biochemical and tissuechanges leading to airway inflammation bronchoconstriction and wheezing Because avoiding or at leastminimizing exposure is the most effective way of treating asthma it is vital to identify which allergen or irritantis causing symptoms in a particular patient Once asthmais present symptoms can be set off or made worse if thepatient also has rhinitis inflammation of the lining of the nose or sinusitis When for some reason stomachacid passes back up the esophagus acid reflux this canalso make asthma worse A viral infection of the respiratory tract can also inflame an asthmatic reaction Aspirinand a type of drug called betablockers often used totreat high blood pressure can also worsen the symptomsof asthma The most important inhaled allergens giving rise to attacks of asthma are animal dander mites in house dust fungi molds that grow indoors cockroach allergens pollen occupational exposure to chemicals fumes or particles of industrial materials in the air Inhaling tobacco smoke either by smoking or being near people who are smoking can irritate the airwaysand trigger an asthmatic attack Air pollutants can have asimilar effect In addition there are three important factors that regularly produce attacks in certain asthmaticpatients and they may sometimes be the sole cause ofsymptoms They are GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AsthmaGEM to A PM Page inhaling cold air coldinduced asthma exerciseinduced asthma in certain children asthma is caused simply by exercising stress or a high level of anxiety Wheezing is often very obvious but mild asthmatic attacks may be confirmed when the physician listens tothe patients chest with a stethoscope Besides wheezingand being short of breath the patient may cough and may report a feeling of tightness in the chest Childrenmay have itching on their back or neck at the start of an attack Wheezing is often loudest when the patientbreathes out in an attempt to expel used air through thenarrowed airways Some asthmatics are free of symptoms most of the time but may occasionally be short ofbreath for a brief time Others spend much of their daysand nights coughing and wheezing until properly treated Crying or even laughing may bring on an attackSevere episodes are often seen when the patient gets aviral respiratory tract infection or is exposed to a heavyload of an allergen or irritant Asthmatic attacks may lastonly a few minutes or can go on for hours or even days acondition called status asthmaticus Being short of breath may cause a patient to become very anxious sit upright lean forward and use the muscles of the neck and chest wall to help breathe Thepatient may be able to say only a few words at a timebefore stopping to take a breath Confusion and a bluishtint to the skin are clues that the oxygen supply is muchtoo low and that emergency treatment is needed In asevere attack that lasts for some time some of the airsacs in the lung may rupture so that air collects withinthe chest This makes it even harder to breathe in enoughair Almost always even patients with the most severeattacks will recover completely Diagnosis Apart from listening to the patients chest the exam iner should look for maximum chest expansion whiletaking in air Hunched shoulders and contracting neckmuscles are other signs of narrowed airways Nasalpolyps or increased amounts of nasal secretions are oftennoted in asthmatic patients Skin changes like atopic dermatitis or eczema are a tipoff that the patient has allergic problems Inquiring about a family history of asthma or aller giescan be a valuable indicator of asthma The diagnosis may be strongly suggested when typical symptoms andsigns are present A test called spirometry measures howrapidly air is exhaled and how much is retained in thelungs Repeating the test after the patient inhales a drugthat widens the air passages a bronchodilator will showwhether the airway narrowing is reversible which is a very typical finding in asthma Often patients use a related instrument called a peak flow meter to keep track ofasthma severity when at home Often it is difficult to determine what is triggering asthma attacks Allergy skin testing may be usedalthough an allergic skin response does not always meanthat the allergen being tested is causing the asthma Alsothe bodys immune system produces antibody to fight offthe allergen and the amount of antibody can be measured by a blood test This will show how sensitive thepatient is to a particular allergen If the diagnosis is stillin doubt the patient can inhale a suspect allergen whileusing a spirometer to detect airway narrowing Spirometry can also be repeated after a bout of exercise if exerciseinduced asthma is a possibility A chest x ray will help rule out other disorders Treatment Patients should be periodically examined and have their lung function measured by spirometry to make surethat treatment goals are being met These goals are to prevent troublesome symptoms to maintain lung function asclose to normal as possible and to allow patients to pursue their normal activities including those requiring exertion The best drug therapy is that which controls asthmatic symptoms while causing few or no sideeffects Drugs METHYLXANTHINES The chief methylxanthine drug is theophylline It may exert some antiinflammatoryeffect and is especially helpful in controlling nighttimesymptoms of asthma When for some reason a patientcannot use an inhaler to maintain longterm control sustainedrelease theophylline is a good alternative Theblood levels of the drug must be measured periodicallyas too high a dose can cause an abnormal heart rhythm orconvulsions BETARECEPTOR AGONISTS These drugs which are bronchodilators are the best choice for relieving sudden attacks of asthma and for preventing attacks from beingtriggered by exercise Some agonists such as albuterolact mainly in lung cells and have little effect on otherorgans such as the heart These drugs generally start acting within minutes but their effects last only four to sixhours although longeracting forms are being developed They may be taken by mouth inhaled or injected STEROIDS These drugs which resemble natural body hormones block inflammation and are extremelyeffective in relieving symptoms of asthma Whensteroids are taken by inhalation for a long period asthma GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AsthmaGEM to A PM Page attacks become less frequent as the airways become less sensitive to allergens This is the strongest medicine forasthma and can control even severe cases over the longterm and maintain good lung function Steroids cancause numerous sideeffects however including bleeding from the stomach loss of calcium from bonescataracts in the eye and a diabeteslike state Patients using steroids for lengthy periods may also have problems with wound healing may gain weight and may suffer mental problems In children growth may be slowedBesides being inhaled steroids may be taken by mouthor injected to rapidly control severe asthma LEUKOTRIENE MODIFIERS Leukotriene modifiers are a new type of drug that can be used in place ofsteroids for older children or adults who have a milddegree of asthma that persists They work by counteracting leukotrienes which are substances released by white blood cells in the lung that cause the air passages to constrict and promote mucus secretion OTHER DRUGS Cromolyn and nedocromil are anti inflammatory drugs that are often used as initial treatmentto prevent asthmatic attacks over the long term in childrenThey can also prevent attacks when given before exerciseor when exposure to an allergen cannot be avoided Theseare safe drugs but are expensive and must be taken regularly even if there are no symptoms Anticholinergic drugssuch as atropine are useful in controlling severe attackswhen added to an inhaled betareceptor agonist They helpwiden the airways and suppress mucus production If a patients asthma is caused by an allergen that cannot be avoided and it has been difficult to controlsymptoms by drugs immunotherapy may be worth try GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Asthma In normal bronchioles the airway is open and unobstructed During an attack the bronchioles of an asthma sufferer are constricted by bandsof muscle around them They may befurther obstructed by increased mucusproduction and tissue inflammation A comparison of normal bronchioles and those of an asthma sufferer Illustration by Hans CassadyGEM to A PM Page ing Typically increasing amounts of the allergen are injected over a period of three to five years so that thebody can build up an effective immune response Thereis a risk that this treatment may itself cause the airwaysto become narrowed and bring on an asthmatic attackNot all experts are enthusiastic about immunotherapyalthough some studies have shown that it does reduceasthmatic symptoms caused by exposure to housedustmites ragweed pollen and cats Managing asthmatic attacks A severe asthma attack should be treated as quickly as possible It is most important for a patient suffering anacute attack to be given extra oxygen Rarely it may benecessary to use a mechanical ventilator to help thepatient breathe A betareceptor agonist is inhaled repeatedly or continuously If the patient does not respondpromptly and completely a steroid is given A course ofsteroid therapy given after the attack is over will make arecurrence less likely Maintaining control Longterm asthma treatment is based on inhaling a betareceptor agonist using a special inhaler that meters thedose Patients must be instructed in proper use of an inhalerto be sure that it will deliver the right amount of drug Onceasthma has been controlled for several weeks or months itis worth trying to cut down on drug treatment but this mustbe done gradually The last drug added should be the first tobe reduced Patients should be seen every one to sixmonths depending on the frequency of attacks Starting treatment at home rather than in hospital makes for minimal delay and helps the patient to gain asense of control over the disease All patients should betaught how to monitor their symptoms so that they willknow when an attack is starting and those with moderateor severe asthma should know how to use a flow meterThey should also have a written action plan to follow ifsymptoms suddenly become worse including how toadjust their medication and when to seek medical help Ifmore intense treatment is necessary it should be continued for several days Overthecounter remedies shouldbe avoided When deciding whether a patient should behospitalized the past history of acute attacks severity ofsymptoms current medication and whether good supportis available at home all must be taken into account Referral to an asthma specialist should be considered if there has been a lifethreatening asthma attack or severe persistent asthma treatment for three to six months has not met its goals some other condition such as nasal polyps or chronic lung disease is complicating asthma special tests such as allergy skin testing or an allergen challenge are needed intensive steroid therapy has been necessary Special populations INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN It is especially important to closely watch the course of asthma in youngpatients Treatment is cut down when possible and ifthere is no clear improvement some other treatmentshould be tried If a viral infection leads to severe asthmatic symptoms steroids may help The health careprovider should write out an asthma treatment plan forthe childs school Asthmatic children often need medication at school to control acute symptoms or to preventexercise induced attacks Proper management will usually allow a child to take part in play activities Only as alast resort should activities be limited THE ELDERLY Older persons often have other types of obstructive lung disease such as chronic bronchitis or emphysema This makes it important to know to what extent the symptoms are caused by asthma Giving steroidsfor two to three weeks can help determine this Sideeffectsfrom betareceptor agonist drugs including a speedingheart and tremor may be more common in older patientsThese patients may benefit from receiving an anticholinergic drug along with the betareceptor agonist If theophylline is given the dose should be limited as olderpatients are less able to clear this drug from their bloodSteroids should be avoided as they often make elderlypatients confused and agitated Steroids may also furtherweaken the bones Prognosis Most patients with asthma respond well when the best drug or combination of drugs is found and they areable to lead relatively normal lives More than half ofaffected children stop having attacks by the time theyreach years of age Many others have less frequentand less severe attacks as they grow older Urgent measures to control asthma attacks and ongoing treatment toprevent attacks are equally important A small minorityof patients will have progressively more trouble breathing and they run a risk of going into respiratory failure and they must receive intensive treatment Prevention Minimizing exposure to allergens There are a number of ways to cut down exposure to the common allergens and irritants that provoke asthmatic attacks or to avoid them altogether GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AsthmaGEM to A PM Page If the patient is sensitive to a family pet remove the animal or at least keep it out of the bedroom with thebedroom door closed Keep the pet away from carpetsand upholstered furniture Remove all feathers To reduce exposure to house dust mites remove wall towall carpeting keep the humidity down and use special pillow and mattress covers Cut down on stuffedtoys and wash them each week in hot water If cockroach allergen is causing asthma attacks kill the roaches using poison traps or boric acid rather thanchemicals Take care not to leave food or garbageexposed Keep indoor air clean by vacuuming carpets once or twice a week with the patient absent avoid usinghumidifiers and do use

properly focus an image onto the retina Theresult is a blurred image Description The cornea is the outermost part of the eye It is a transparent layer that covers the colored part of the eyeiris pupil and lens The cornea bends light and helps tofocus it onto the retina where specialized cells photoreceptors detect light and transmit nerve impulses viathe optic nerve to the brain where the image is formedThe cornea is dome shaped Any incorrect shaping of thecornea results in an incorrect focusing of the light thatpasses through that part of the cornea The bending oflight is called refraction and focusing problems with thecornea are called diseases of refraction or refractive disorders Astigmatism is an image distortion that resultsfrom an improperly shaped cornea Usually the cornea isspherically shaped like a baseball However in astigmatism the cornea is elliptically shaped more like a football There is a long meridian and a short meridianThese two meridians generally have a constant curvatureand are generally perpendicular to each other regularastigmatism Irregular astigmatism may have more thantwo meridians of focus and they may not be apart Apoint of light therefore going through an astigmaticcornea will have two points of focus instead of one nicesharp image on the retina This will cause the person tohave blurry vision What the blur looks like will dependupon the amount and the direction of the astigmatism Aperson with nearsightedness myopia or farsightedness GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AstigmatismGEM to A PM Page hyperopia may see a dot as a blurred circle A person with astigmatism may see the same dot as a blurred ovalor frankfurtershaped blur Some cases of astigmatism are caused by problems in the lens of the eye Minor variations in the curvature ofthe lens can produce minor degrees of astigmatismlenticular astigmatism In these patients the cornea isusually normal in shape Infants as a group have theleast amount of astigmatism Astigmatism may increaseduring childhood as the eye is developing Causes and symptoms The main symptom of astigmatism is blurring Peo ple can also experience headaches and eyestrain Parentscan notice that a child may have astigmatism when thechild can see some part of a pattern or picture more clearly than others For example lines going across may seemclearer than lines going up and down Regular astigmatism can be caused by the weight of the upper eyelid resting on the eyeball creating distortionsurgical incisions in the cornea trauma or scarring to thecornea the presence of tumors in the eyelid or a developmental factor Irregular astigmatism can be caused by scarring or keratoconus Keratoconus is a condition in whichthe cornea thins and becomes cone shaped It usuallyoccurs around puberty and is more common in women Although the causes of keratoconus are unknown it maybe hereditary or a result of chronic eye rubbing as in people with allergies The center of the cone may not be in line with the center of the cornea Diabetes can play a rolein the development of astigmatism High blood sugar levels can cause shape changes in the lens of the eye Thisprocess usually occurs slowly and often is only noticedwhen the diabetic has started treatment to control theirblood sugar The return to a more normal blood sugarallows the lens to return to normal and this change issometimes noticed by the patient as farsightednessBecause of this diabetics should wait until their bloodsugar is under control for at least one month to allowvision to stabilize before being measured for eyeglasses Diagnosis Patients seek treatment because of blurred vision A variety of tests can be used to detect astigmatism duringthe eye exam The patient may be asked to describe theastigmatic dial a series of lines that radiate outward froma center People with astigmatism will see some of thelines more clearly than others One diagnostic instrumentused is the keratometer This measures the curvature ofthe central cornea It measures the amount and directionof the curvature A corneal topographer can measure alarger area of the cornea It can measure the central area and midperiphery of the cornea A keratoscope projectsa series of concentric light rings onto the cornea Misshapen areas of the cornea are revealed by noting areasof the light pattern that do not appear concentric on thecornea Because these instruments are measuring thecornea it is also important to have a refraction in case thelens is also contributing to the astigmatism The refraction measures the optics or visual status of the eye andthe result is the eyeglass prescription The refraction iswhen the patient is looking at an eye chart and the doctoris putting different lenses in front of the patients eyesand asks which one looks better Treatment Astigmatism can be treated by the use of cylindrical lenses They can be in eyeglasses or contact lenses Theunit of measure describing the power of the lens system orlens is called the diopter D The lenses are shaped tocounteract the shape of the sections of cornea that are causing the difficulty Because the correction is in one directionit is

with very small amounts of astigmatism should be treated Generally if visual acuity is good and the patient experiencesno overt symptoms treatment is not necessary Whentreating larger amounts of astigmatism or astigmatismfor the first time the doctor may not totally correct theastigmatism The cylindrical correction in the eyeglassesmay make the floor appear to tilt thus making it difficultfor the patient at first Generally the doctor will placelenses in a trial frame to allow the patient to try the prescription at the exam It may take a week or so to getused to the glasses however if the patient is having aproblem they should contact their doctor who mightwant to recheck the prescription Contact lenses that are used to correct astigmatism are called toric lenses When a person blinks the contactlens rotates In toric lenses it is important for the lens toreturn to the same position each time Lenses have thinzones or cutoff areas truncated or have other ways torotate and return to the correct position Soft toric lensesare available in a variety of prescriptions materials andeven in tints Patients should ask their doctors about thepossibility of toric lenses In the Food and Drug Administration FDA approved laser treatment of astigmatism Patients considering this should make sure the surgeon has a lot of experience in the procedure and discuss the possible sideeffects or risks with the doctor In the case of keratoconus a corneal transplant is performed if the astigmatism can not be corrected with hard contact lenses Prognosis Astigmatism is a condition that may be present

ParadigmCorporationGEM to A PM Page hood that progressively destroys part of the motor control area of the brain leading to a lack of balance and coordination AT also affects the immune system and increases therisk of leukemia and lymphoma in affected individuals Description The disorder first appeared in the medical literature in the mids but was not named specifically until The name is a combination of two recognized abnormalities ataxia lack of muscle control and telangiectasiaabnormal dilatation of capillary vessels that often result intumors and red skin lesions However AT involves more than just the sum of these two findings Other associatedAT problems include immune system deficienciesextreme sensitivity to radiation and blood cancers Medical researchers initially suspected that multiple genes the units responsible for inherited features wereinvolved However in mutations in a single largegene were identified as causing AT Researchers namedthe gene ATM for AT mutated Subsequent researchrevealed that ATM has a significant role in regulating celldivision The symptoms associated with AT reflect themain role of the AT gene which is to induce several cellular responses to DNA damage such as preventing damagedDNA from being reproduced When the AT gene is mutatedinto ATM the signaling networks are affected and the cellno longer responds correctly to minimize the damage AT is very rare but it occurs in every population world wide with an estimated frequency of between and live births But it is believed thatmany AT cases particularly those who die at a youngage are never properly diagnosed Therefore this diseasemay actually be much more prevalent According to theAT Project Foundation an estimated million inthe United States of the general population carries defective AT genes Carriers of one copy of this gene do notdevelop AT but have a significantly increased risk ofcancer This makes the AT gene one of the most impor tant cancerrelated genes identified to date Causes and symptoms The ATM gene is autosomal recessive meaning the disease occurs only if a defective gene is inherited fromboth parents Infants with AT initially often appear veryhealthy At around age two ataxia and nervous systemabnormalities becomes apparent The root cause of ATassociated ataxia is cell death in the brain specifically the large branching cells of the nervous system Purkinjes cells which are located in the cerebellum A toddlerbecomes clumsy loses balance easily and lacks musclecontrol Speech becomes slurred and more difficult andthe symptoms progressively worsen Between ages twoand eight telangiectases or tiny red spider veins appear on the cheeks and ears and in the eyes By age children with AT can no longer control their muscles Immune system deficiencies become common and affected individuals are extremely sensitive toradiation Immune system deficiencies vary between individuals but include lowerthannormal levels of proteinsthat function as antibodies immunoglobulins and whiteblood cells blood cells not containing iron proteins Thethymus gland which aids in development of the bodysimmune system is either missing or has developed abnormally Intelligence is normal but growth may be retardedowing to immune system or hormonal deficiencies Individuals with AT are also sometimes afflicted with diabetes prematurely graying hair and difficulty swallowingAs the children grow older the immune system becomesweaker and less capable of fighting infection In the laterstages recurrent respiratory infections and blood cancerssuch as leukemia or lymphoma are common Diagnosis Diagnosis relies on recognizing the hallmarks of A T progressive ataxia and telangiectasia However thismay be difficult as ataxia symptoms do appear prior totelangiectasia symptoms by several years Other symptoms can vary between individuals for example ofindividuals with AT have a high incidence of respiratoryinfection do not The identification of the ATMgene raises hopes that screening and perhaps treatmentmay be possible Treatment There is currently no cure for AT and treatment focuses on managing the individuals multiple symptoms Physical therapy and speech therapy can help thepatient adjust to ataxia Injections of gamma globulin orextracts of human blood that contain antibodies are usedto strengthen the weakened immune system Highdosevitamin administrations may also be prescribedResearch continues in many countries to find effectivetreatments Individuals and families living with this disorder may benefit from attending support groups Prognosis AT is a fatal condition Children with AT become physically disabled by their early teens and typically dieby their early s usually from the associated blood cancers and malignancies In very rare cases individualswith AT may experience slower progression and aslightly longer life span surviving into their s ATcarriers have a fivefold higher risk than noncarriers

affecting part or all of one lung This condition prevents normal oxygen absoption to healthy tissues GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AtelectasisGEM to A PM Page Description Atelectasis can result from an obstruction block age of the airways that affects tiny air scas called alveoli Alveoli are very thinwalled and contain a rich bloodsupply They are important for lung function since theirpurpose is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxideWhen the airways are blocked by a mucous plug foreign object or tumor the alveoli are unable to fill withair and collapse of lung tissue can occur in the affectedarea Atelectasis is a potential complication followingsurgery especially in individuals who have undergonechest or abdominal operations resulting in associatedabdominal or chest pain during breathing Congenital atelectasis can result from a failure of the lungs toexpand at birth This congenital condition may be localized or may affect all of both lungs Causes and symptoms Causes of atelectasis include insufficient attemps at respiration by the newborn bronchial obstruction orabsence of surfactant a substance secreted by alveolithat maintains the stability of lung tissue by reducing thesurface tension of fluids that coat the lung This lack ofsurfactant reduces the surface area available for effectivegas exchange causing it to collapse if severe Pressure onthe lung from fluid or air can cause atelectasis as well asobstruction of lung air passages by thick mucus resultingfrom various infections and lung diseases Tumors andinhaled objects can also cause obstruction of the airway leading to atelectasis Anyone undergoing chest or abdominal surgery using general anesthesia is at risk to develop atelectasissince breathing is often shallow after surgery to avoidpain from the surgical incision Any significant decreasein airflow to the alveoli contributes to pooling of secretions which in turn can cause infection Chest injuriescausing shallow breathing including fractured ribs cancause atelectasis Common symptoms of atelectasisinclude shortness of breath and decreased chest wall expansion If atelectasis only afects a small area of thelung symptoms are ususally minimal If the conditionaffects a large area of the lung and develops quickly theindividual may turn blue cyanotic or pale have extremeshortness of breath and feel a stabbing pain on theaffected side Fever and increased heart rate may be pre sent if infection accompanies atelectasis Diagnosis To diagnose atelectasis a doctor starts by recording the patients symptoms and performing a thorough phys ical examination When the doctor listens to the lungs through a stethoscope ausculation diminished orbronchial breath sounds may be heard By tapping on thechest percussion while listening through the stethoscope the doctor can often tell if the lung is collapsed Achest x ray that shows an airless area in the lung con firms the diagnosis of atelectasis If an obstruction of theairways is suspected a computed tomography scan CTor bronchoscopy may be performed to locate the cause of the blockage Treatment If atelectasis is due to obstruction of the airway the first step in treatment is to remove the cause of the blockage This may be done by coughing suctioning or bronchoscopy If a tumor is the cause of atelectasis surgerymay be necessary to remove it Antibiotics are commonly used to fight the infection that often accompanies atelectasis In cases where recurrent or longlasting infection isdisabling or where significant bleeding occurs the affected section of the lung may be surgically removed Prognosis If atelectasis is caused by a thick mucus plug or inhaled foreign object the patient usually recovers completely when the blockage is removed If it is caused by atumor the outcome depends on the nature of the tumorinvolved If atelectasis is a result of surgery other postoperative conditions andor complications affect the prognosis GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF

When recovering from surgery frequent reposi tioning in bed along with coughing and deep breathingare important Coughing and breathing deeply everyone to two hours after any surgical operation with general anesthesia is recommended Breathing exercisesand the use of breathing devices such as an incentivespirometer may also help prevent atelectasisAlthough smokers have a higher risk of developingatelectasis following surgery stopping smoking six to eight weeks before surgery can help reduce the riskIncreasing fluid intake during respiratory illness orafter surgery by mouth or intravenously helps lungsecretions to remain loose Increasing humidity mayalso be beneficial Postural drainage techniques can be learned from a respiratory therapist or physical therapist and are a

Atherectomy Definition Atherectomy is a nonsurgical procedure to open blocked coronary arteries or vein grafts by using a deviceon the end of a catheter to cut or shave away atherosclerotic plaque a deposit of fat and other substances thataccumulate in the lining of the artery wall Purpose Atherectomy is performed to restore the flow of oxygenrich blood to the heart to relieve chest pain and to prevent heart attacks It may be done on patients withchest pain who have not responded to other medical therapy and on certain of those who are candidates for balloon angioplasty a surgical procedure in which a bal loon catheter is used to flatten plaque against an arterywall or coronary artery bypass graft surgery It is GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AtherectomyGEM to A PM Page sometimes performed to remove plaque that has built up after a coronary artery bypass graft surgery Precautions Atherectomy should not be performed when the plaque is located where blood vessels divide into branches when plaque is angular or inside an angle of a bloodvessel on patients with weak vessel walls on ulceratedor calciumhardened lesions or on blockages throughwhich a guide wire wont pass Description Atherectomy uses a rotating shaver or other device placed on the end of a catheter to slice away or destroyplaque At the beginning of the procedure medications tocontrol blood pressure dilate the coronary arteries andprevent blood clots are administered The patient isawake but sedated The catheter is inserted into an arteryin the groin leg or arm and threaded through the bloodvessels into the blocked coronary artery The cuttinghead is positioned against the plaque and activated andthe plaque is ground up or suctioned outThe types of atherectomy are rotational directional and transluminal extraction Rotational atherectomy uses ahigh speed rotating shaver to grind up plaque Directionalatherectomy was the first type approved but is no longercommonly used it scrapes plaque into an opening in oneside of the catheter Transluminal extraction coronaryatherectomy uses a device that cuts plaque off vessel wallsand vacuums it into a bottle It is used to clear bypass grafts Performed in a cardiac catheterization lab atherec tomy is also called removal of plaque from the coronaryarteries It can be used instead of or along with balloonangioplasty Atherectomy is successful about of

Definition Atherosclerosis is the build up of a waxy plaque on the inside of blood vessels In Greek athere means gruel and skleros means hard Atherosclerosis is often called arteriosclerosis Arteriosclerosis from the Greek arteria meaning artery is a general term for hardening of the arteries Arteriosclerosis can occur in several formsincluding atherosclerosis Description Atherosclerosis a progressive process responsible for most heart disease is a type of arteriosclerosis orhardening of the arteries An artery is made up of severallayers an inner lining called the endothelium an elasticmembrane that allows the artery to expand and contracta layer of smooth muscle and a layer of connective tissue Arteriosclerosis is a broad term that includes a hardening of the inner and middle layers of the artery It canbe caused by normal aging by high blood pressure and by diseases such as diabetes Atherosclerosis is a type ofarteriosclerosis that affects only the inner lining of anartery It is characterized by plaque deposits that blockthe flow of blood Plaque is made of fatty substances cholesterol waste products from the cells calcium and fibrin astringy material that helps clot blood The plaque formation process stimulates the cells of the artery wall to produce substances that accumulate in the inner layer Fatbuilds up within these cells and around them and theyform connective tissue and calcium The inner layer ofthe artery wall thickens the arterys diameter is reducedand blood flow and oxygen delivery are decreasedPlaques can rupture or crack open causing the suddenformation of a blood clot thrombosis Atherosclerosis GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AtherosclerosisGEM to A PM Page can cause a heart attack if it completely blocks the blood flow in the heart coronary arteries It can cause astroke if it completely blocks the brain carotid arteries Atherosclerosis can also occur in the arteries of the neckkidneys thighs and arms causing kidney failure or gan grene and amputation Causes and symptoms Atherosclerosis can begin in the late teens but it usually takes decades to cause symptoms Some peopleexperience rapidly progressing atherosclerosis duringtheir thirties others during their fifties or sixties Atherosclerosis is complex Its exact cause is still unknown It isthought that atherosclerosis is caused by a response todamage to the endothelium from high cholesterol high blood pressure and cigarette smoking A person who has all three of these risk factors is eight times more likely todevelop atherosclerosis than is a person who has nonePhysical inactivity diabetes and obesity are also risk factors for atherosclerosis High levels of the amino acidhomocysteine and abnormal levels of proteincoated fatscalled lipoproteins also raise the risk of coronary artery disease These substances are the targets of much current research The role of triglycerides another fat that circulates in the blood in forming atherosclerotic plaques isunclear High levels of triglycerides are often associatedwith diabetes obesity and low levels of highdensitylipoproteins HDL cholesterol The more HDL goodcholesterol in the blood the less likely is coronary arterydisease These risk factors are all modifiable Nonmodifiable risk factors are heredity sex and age Risk factors that can be changed Cigarettetobacco smokeSmoking increases both the chance of developing atherosclerosis and the chance ofdying from coronary heart disease Second hand smokemay also increase risk High blood cholesterolCholesterol a soft waxy sub stance comes from foods such as meat eggs and otheranimal products and is produced in the liver Age sexheredity and diet affect cholesterol Total blood cholesterol is considered high at levels above mgdL andborderline at mgdL Highrisk levels of lowdensity lipoprotein LDL cholesterol begin at mgdL High triglyceridesMost fat in food and in the body takes the form of triglycerides Blood triglyceride levels above mgdL have been linked to coronaryartery disease in some people Triglycerides howeverare not nearly as harmful as LDL cholesterol High blood pressureBlood pressure of over or higher makes the heart work harder and over time bothweakens the heart and harms the arteries Physical inactivityLack of exercise increases the risk of atherosclerosis Diabetes mellitusThe risk of developing atheroscle rosis is seriously increased for diabetics and can belowered by keeping diabetes under control Most diabetics die from heart attacks caused by atherosclerosis ObesityExcess weight increases the strain on the heart and increases the risk of developing atherosclerosis even if no other risk factors are present Risk factors that cannot be changed HeredityPeople whose parents have coronary artery disease atherosclerosis or stroke at an early age are atincreased risk The high rate of severe hypertension among AfricanAmericans puts them at increased risk SexBefore age men are more likely to have heart attacks than women are After age the risk is equalamong men and women AgeRisk is higher in men who are years of age and older and women who are years of age and older Symptoms differ depending upon the location of the atherosclerosis In the coronary heart arteries Chest pain heart attack or sudden death In the carotid brain arteries Sudden dizziness weak ness loss of speech or blindness In the femoral leg arteries Disease of the blood ves sels in the outer parts of the body peripheral vascular disease causes cramping and fatigue in the calves when walking In the renal kidney arteries High blood pressure that is difficult to treat Diagnosis Physicians may be able to make a diagnosis of athero sclerosis during a physical exam by means of a stethoscope and gentle probing of the arteries with the hand palpation More definite tests are electrocardiography echocardiography or ultrasonography of the arteries for example the carotids radionuclide scans and angiogra phy An

up completely Description Athletes foot is a very common condition of itchy peeling skin on the feet In fact its so common that mostpeople will have at least one episode at least once in theirlives Its less often found in women and children underage Symptoms that look like athletes foot in youngchildren most probably are caused by some other skincondition Because the fungi grow well in warm damp areas they flourish in and around swimming pools showersand locker rooms Tinea pedis got its common namebecause the infection was common among athletes whooften used these areas Causes and symptoms Athletes foot is caused by a fungal infection that most often affects the fourth and fifth toe webs Trichophy ton rubrum T mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton floc cosum the fungi that cause athletes foot are unusual in that they live exclusively on dead body tissue hair theouter layer of skin and nails The fungus grows best inmoist damp dark places with poor ventilation The problem doesnt occur among people who usually go barefoot Many people carry the fungus on their skin Howev er it will only flourish to the point of causing athletesfoot if conditions are right Many people believe athletesfoot is highly contagious especially in public swimmingpools and shower rooms Research has shown howeverthat it is difficult to pick up the infection simply by walking barefoot over a contaminated damp floor Exactlywhy some people develop the condition and others dontis not well understood Sweaty feet tight shoes synthetic socks that dont absorb moisture well a warm climate and not drying thefeet well after swimming or bathing all contribute to theovergrowth of the fungus Symptoms of athletes foot include itchy sore skin on the toes with scaling cracking inflammation andblisters Blisters that break exposing raw patches of tissue can cause pain and swelling As the infection spreads itching and burning may get worse If its not treated athletes foot can spread to the soles of the feet and toenails Stubborn toenail infectionsmay appear at the same time with crumbling scaling andthickened nails and nail loss The infection can spreadfurther if patients scratch and then touch themselves else GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Athletes footGEM to A PM Page where especially in the groin or under the arms Its also possible to spread the infection to other parts of the bodyvia contaminated bed sheets or clothing Diagnosis Not all foot rashes are athletes foot which is why a physician should diagnose the condition before anyremedies are used Using nonprescription products on arash that is not athletes foot could make the rash worse A dermatologist can diagnose the condition by physical examination and by examining a preparation of skin scrapings under a microscope This test called aKOH preparation treats a sample of tissue scraped fromthe infected area with heat and potassium hydroxideKOH This treatment dissolves certain substances inthe tissue sample making it possible to see the fungiunder the microscope Treatment Athletes foot may be resistant to medication and should not be ignored Simple cases usually respond wellto antifungal creams or sprays clotrimazole ketoconazole miconazole nitrate sulconazole nitrate or tolnaftate If the infection is resistant to topical treatment thedoctor may prescribe an oral antifungal drug Untreated athletes

of strenuous physical training It can be difficult to distinguish asignificant medical condition from an athletic heart Description The heart adapts to physical demands by enlarging especially the left ventricle Enlargement increases thecardiac output the amount of blood pumped with eachbeat of the heart The exact type of adaptation dependson the nature of the physical demand There are twotypes of demand static and dynamic Static demandinvolves smaller groups of muscles under extreme resistance for brief period An example is weight liftingDynamic training involves larger groups of muscles atlower resistance for extended periods of time Examplesare aerobic training and tennis Cardiac enlargement isassociated with dynamic training The hearts response tostatic training is hypertrophy thickening of the musclewalls of the heart As the wall of the heart adapts thereare changes in the electrical conducting system of theheart Because of the larger volume of blood beingpumped with each heart beat the heart rate when at restdecreases below the normal level for nonathletes Sudden unexpected death SUD is the death of an athlete usually during or shortly after physical activityOften there is no warning that the person will experienceSUD although in some cases warning signs appearwhich cause the person to seek medical advice Importantly cases of death occurring during physical activityare not caused by athletic heart syndrome but by undiagnosed heart disorders Causes and symptoms Athletic heart syndrome is the consequence of a nor mal adaptation by the heart to increased physical activityThe changes in the electrical conduction system of theheart may be pronounced and diagnostic but should notcause problems In the case of SUD other heart problems are involved In of the cases of SUD anunderlying structural defect of the heart has been noted Diagnosis The changes in the heart beat caused by the electri cal conduction system of the heart are detectable on anelectrocardiogram Many of the changes seen in athleticheart syndrome mimic those of various heart diseasesCareful examination must be made to distinguish heartdisease from athletic heart syndrome Prognosis The yearly rate for occurrence of SUD in people less than years of age is less than seven incidents per Of all SUD cases only about are exercise related On a national basis this means that

Definition The Atkins diet is a highprotein highfat and very lowcarbohydrate regimen It emphasizes meat cheeseand eggs while discouraging foods such as bread pastafruit and sugar It is a form of ketogenic diet Purpose The primary benefit of the diet is rapid and substan tial weight loss By restricting carbohydrate intake thebody will burn more fat stored in the body Since there areno limits on the amount of calories or quantities of foodsallowed on the diet there is little hunger between mealsAccording to Atkins the diet can alleviate symptoms of GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Athletic heart syndromeGEM to A PM Page conditions such as fatigue irritability headaches depres sion and some types of joint and muscle pain Description The regimen is a lowcarbohydrate or ketogenic diet characterized by initial rapid weight loss usuallydue to water loss Drastically reducing the amount of carbohydrate intake causes liver and muscle glycogen losswhich has a strong but temporary diuretic effect Longterm weight loss occurs because with a low amount ofcarbohydrate intake the body burns stored fat for energy The fourstep diet starts with a twoweek induction program designed to rebalance an individuals metabolism Unlimited amounts of fat and protein are allowedbut carbohydrate intake is restricted to grams perday Foods allowed include butter oil meat poultry fisheggs cheese and cream The daily amount of carbohydrates allowed equals about three cups of salad vegetables such as lettuce cucumbers and celery The second stage is for ongoing weight loss It allows grams of carbohydrates a day When theindividual is about pounds from their desired weight they begin the premaintenance phase This graduallyadds one to three servings a week of high carbohydratefoods such as a piece of fruit or slice of wholewheatbread When the desired weight is reached the maintenance stage begins It allows grams of carbohydrates per day Opinion from the general medical community remains mixed on the Atkins diet but is generally unfavorable There have been no significant longterm scientific studies on the diet A number of leading medical andhealth organizations including the American MedicalAssociation American Dietetic Association ADA andthe American Heart Association oppose it It is drastically different than the dietary intakes recommended by theUS Department of Agriculture and

University of Michigan in and received his medical degreefrom Cornell University Medical School in with aspecialty in cardiology As an internist and cardiologist he developed the Atkins Diet in the early s The dietis a ketogenic dieta high protein high fat and verylow carbohydrate regimen resulting in ketosis It emphasizes meat cheese and eggs while discouraging foodssuch as bread pasta fruit and sugar It first came to public attention in with the publication of Dr Atkins Diet Revolution The book quickly became a bestseller but unlike most other fad diet books this one hasremained popular At last count it had been reprinted times and sold more than million copies worldwideSince then Atkins has authored a number of other bookson his diet theme including Dr Atkins New Diet Revo lution Dr

most diets it is generally considered appropriate to consult with a physician and to have aphysical evaluation before starting such a nutritional regimen The evaluation should include blood tests to determine levels of cholesterol triglycerides glucose insulinand uric acid A glucose tolerance test is also recommended Precautions Adherence to the Atkins diet can result in vitamin and mineral deficiencies In his books Atkins recommends a widerange of nutritional supplements including a multivitamin Among his recommendationsAtkins suggests the following daily dosages micrograms mcg of chromium picolinate milligrams mg of pantetheine mcg of selenium and mcg of biotin The diet is not recommended for lactoovo vegetari ans since it cannot be done as successfully without protein derived from animal products Also vegans cannotfollow this diet since a vegan diet is too high in carbohydrates according to Atkins Instead he recommends vegetarians with a serious weight problem give up vegetari anism or at least include fish in their diet Side effects According to Atkins the diet causes no adverse side effects Many health care professionals disagree In a factsheet for the Healthcare Reality Check Web sitehttpwwwhcrcorg Ellen Coleman a registered dietician and author said the diet may have serious sideeffects for some people She said complications associated with the diet include

disorder characterized by chronically inflamedskin and sometimes intolerable itching Description Atopic dermatitis refers to a wide range of diseases that are often associated with stress and allergic disor ders that involve the respiratory system like asthma and hay fever Although atopic dermatitis can appear at any age it is most common in children and young adultsSymptoms usually abate before the age of and do notaffect the patients general health About one in ten babies develop a form of atopic dermatitis called infantile eczema Characterized by skinthat oozes and becomes encrusted infantile eczema mostoften occurs on the face and scalp The condition usuallyimproves before the childs second birthday and medicalattention can keep symptoms in check until that time When atopic dermatitis develops after infancy inflammation blistering oozing and crusting are lesspronounced The patients sores become dry turn fromred to brownishgray and skin may thicken and becomescaly In darkskinned individuals this condition cancause the complexion to lighten or darken Itching associated with this condition is usually worst at night It canbe so intense that patients scratch until their sores bleedsometimes causing scarring and infection Atopic dermatitis affects about of the population of the United States and about of the people whohave the condition have one or more relatives with thesame condition or a similar one Symptoms tend to bemost severe in females Atopic dermatitis can erupt onany part of the skin and crusted thickened patches onthe fingers palms or the soles of the feet can last foryears In teenagers and young adults atopic dermatitisoften appears on one or more of the following areas elbow creases backs of the knees ankles wrists face neck upper chest palms and between the fingers Causes and symptoms While allergic reactions often trigger atopic dermati tis the condition is thought to be the result of an inherited overactive immune system or a genetic defect thatcauses the skin to lose abnormally large amounts ofmoisture The condition can be aggravated by a cycle thatdevelops in which the skin itches the patient scratchesthe condition worsens the itching worsens the patientscratches etc This cycle must be broken by relieving theitching to allow the skin time to heal If the skin becomes GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Atopic

developing skin infections which if not recognized and treated promptly canbecome more serious Symptoms of atopic dermatitis include the following an itchy rash and dry thickened skin on areas of the body where moisture can be trapped continual scratching chronic fatigue caused when itching disrupts sleep An individual is more atrisk for developing the con dition if there is a personal or family history of atopicdermatitis hay fever asthma or other allergies Expo sure to any of the following can cause a flareup hot or cold temperatures wool and synthetic fabrics detergents fabric softeners and chemicals use of drugs that suppress immunesystem activity Certain foods such as peanuts cows milk eggs and fish can trigger symptoms of atopic dermatitis Asmall percentage of patients with atopic dermatitis findthat their symptoms worsen after having been exposed todust feather pillows roughtextured fabrics or othermaterials to which dust adheres Diagnosis Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is usually based on the patients symptoms and personal and family healthhistory Skin tests do not generally provide reliable information about this condition Treatment Atopic dermatitis cannot be cured but the severity and duration of symptoms can be controlled A dermatologist should be consulted when symptoms first appearand is likely to recommend warm baths to loosenencrusted skin followed by applications of petroleumjelly or vegetable shortening to prevent the skins naturalmoisture from escaping Externally applied topical steroids or preparations containing coal tar can relieve minor itching but coal tarhas an unpleasant odor stains clothes and may increaseskincancer risk Excessive use of steroid creams inyoung children can alter growth Pregnant women shouldnot use products that contain coal tar Topical steroids cancause itching burning acne permanent stretch marks and thinning and spotting of the skin Applying topicalsteroids to the area around the eyes can cause glaucoma Oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine Benadryl can relieve symptoms of allergyrelated atopicdermatitis More concentrated topical steroids are recommended for persistent symptoms A mild tranquilizer maybe prescribed to reduce stress and help the patient sleepand antibiotics are used to treat secondary infections Cortisone ointments should be used sparingly and strong preparations should never be applied to the facegroin armpits or rectal area Regular medical monitoring is recommended for patients who use cortisonesalves or lotions to control widespread symptoms Oralcortisone may be prescribed if the patient does notrespond to other treatments but patients who take themedication for more than two weeks have a greaterthanaverage risk of developing severe symptoms when thetreatment is discontinued Allergy shots rarely improve atopic dermatitis and sometimes aggravate the symptoms Since food allergiesmay trigger atopic dermatitis the doctor may suggest GALE

Alternative therapies can sometimes bring relief or resolution of atopic dermatitis when conventional therapies are not helping If the condition becomes increasingly widespread or infected a physician should be consulted Helpful alternative treatments for atopic dermatitis may include Taking regular brisk walks followed by bathing in warm water sprinkled with essential oil of lavenderLavandula officinalis lavender oil acts as a nerve relaxant for the whole body including the skin Supplementing the diet daily with zinc fish oils vita min A vitamin E and evening primrose oil Oenothera biennis all good sources of nutrients for the skin Reducing or eliminating red meat from the diet Eliminating or rotating potentially allergic foods such as cows milk peanuts wheat eggs and soy Implementing stress reduction techniques in daily life Herbal therapies also can be helpful in treating atopic dermatitis Western herbal remedies used in thetreatment of this condition include burdock Arctium lappa and Ruta Ruta graveolens Longterm herbal therapy requires monitoring and should be guided by anexperienced practitioner Other alternative techniques that may be useful in the treatment of atopic

beats Definition Atrial ectopic beats AEB refers to a contraction of the upper heart chamber which occurs before it would beexpected Atrial ectopic beats are also known as premature atrial beats premature atrial complex PAC or atrial extrasystole Description An AEB is usually a harmless disturbance in the normal rhythm of the heart It can occur only occasionally in a regular pattern or several may occur in sequenceand then disappear Most often the person is unaware ofthe event Causes and symptoms As people age extra beats tend to happen more fre quently even in perfectly healthy individuals AEB maybe triggered or increased by stress caffeine smoking and some medicines Cold remedies containing ephedrineor pseudoephedrine have been known to increase the incidence of atrial ectopic beats AEB may also be the resultof an enlarged atria lung disease or the result of reducedblood supply to that area of the heartIf a person is aware of the event the first symptom of AEB is usually a feeling that the heart has skipped ormissed a beat This is often accompanied by a feelingthat the heart is thumping or pounding in the chest Thethumping or pounding is caused by the fact that whenthere is an AEB the pause before the next beat is usuallylonger than normal The next beat must be stronger thanusual to pump the accumulated blood out of the chamber Diagnosis Diagnosis of AEB is often suspected on the basis of the patients description of the occurrence An electrocardiogram ECG can confirm the diagnosis An ECGshows the heart beat as three wave forms The first waveis called P the second is called QRS and the last is T Anatrial ectopic beat will show up on the ECG as a P wavethat occurs closer than usual to the preceding T wave Treatment Atrial ectopic beats do not usually require treatment If treatment is necessary because the beats occur frequently and cause intolerable discomfort the doctor mayprescribe medication Prognosis Occasional AEB usually have no

with the ventricles or lower chambers ofthe heart In atrial fibrillation the atria quiver chaotically and the ventricles beat irregularly In atrial flutter theatria beat regularly and faster than the ventricles Description Atrial fibrillation and flutter are two types of cardiac arrhythmias irregularities in the hearts rhythm Nearly million Americans have atrial fibrillation according tothe American Heart Association It is the most commonchronic arrhythmia Atrial flutter is less common butboth of these arrhythmias can cause a blood clot to formin the heart This can lead to a stroke or a blockage car ried by the blood flow an embolism anywhere in the bodys arteries Atrial fibrillation is responsible for about of strokes The atria are the hearts two small upper chambers In atrial fibrillation the heart beat is completely irregularThe atrial muscles contract very quickly and irregularlythe ventricles the hearts two large lower chambers beatirregularly but not as fast as the atria When the atria fibrillate blood that is not completely pumped out can pool andform a clot In atrial flutter the heart beat is usually veryfast but steady The atria beat faster than the ventricles Atrial fibrillation often occurs in people with various types of heart disease Atrial fibrillation may also resultfrom an inflammation of the hearts covering pericardi tis chest trauma or surgery pulmonary disease and cer tain medications Atrial fibrillation is more common inolder people about of people over the age of have it Atrial flutter and fibrillation usually occur in people with hypertensive or coronary heart disease and othertypes of heart disorders Causes and symptoms In most cases the cause of atrial fibrillation and flut ter can be found but often it cannot Causes of theseheart beat abnormalities include many types of heart disease stress and anxiety caffeine alcohol tobacco diet pills some prescription and overthecounter medications open heart surgery Symptoms when present include a fluttering feeling in the chest a pulse that feels like the heart is skipping racing jump ing or is irregular low energy a faint or dizzy feeling pressure or discomfort in the chest shortness of breath anxiety Diagnosis A doctor can sometimes hear these arrhythmias using an instrument a stethoscope to listen to thesounds within the chest Atrial fibrillation and flutter areusually diagnosed through electrocardiography EKGs an exercisestress test a hour Holter EKG monitor or a telephone cardiac monitor An EKG showsthe hearts activity and may reveal a lack of oxygenischemia Electrodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on the patients chest arms and legs The electrodes send impulses of the hearts activity through amonitor called an oscilloscope to a recorder that tracesthe pattern of the impulses onto paper The test takesabout minutes and is performed in a doctors officeThe exercise stress test measures how the heart and bloodvessels respond to work when the patient is exercising ona treadmill or a stationary bike This test is performed ina doctors office within an exercise laboratory and takes minutes In hour EKG Holter monitoring the patient wears a small portable tape recorder connected to diskson hisher chest that record the hearts rhythm duringnormal activities An EKG called transtelephonic monitoring identifies arrhythmias that occur infrequentlyLike Holter monitoring transtelephonic monitoring continues for days or weeks and enables patients to sendthe EKG via telephone to a monitoring station when anarrhythmia is felt or to store the information in therecorder and transmit it later Doctors can also use highfrequency sound waves echocardiography to deter mine the structure and function of the heart This diagnostic method is often helpful to evaluate for underlyingheart disease Treatment Atrial fibrillation and flutter are usually treated with medications andor electrical shock cardioversion In GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Atrial fibrillation and flutterGEM to A PM Page some cases removal of a small portion of the heart abla tion implantation of a pacemaker or a cardioverterdefibrillator or maze surgery is needed If the heart rate cannot be quickly controlled electri cal cardioversion may be used Cardioversion the electric shock to the chest wall is usually performed emergencies This device briefly suspends the hearts activityand allows it to return to a normal rhythm Ablation destroys the heart tissue that causes the arrhythmia The tissue can be destroyed by catheterization or surgery Radiofrequency catheter ablation per formed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory can cure atrial flutter and control the heart rate in atrial fibrillation The patient is awake but sedated A thin tubecalled a catheter is inserted into a vein and is threadedinto the heart At the end of the catheter a device mapsthe electrical pathways of the heart A cardiologist adoctor specializing in the heart uses this map to identifythe pathways causing the arrhythmia and then eliminates it them with bursts of highfrequency radiowaves Surgical ablation is performed in an operatingroom under general anesthesia Computerized mappingtechniques are combined with a cold probe to destroyarrhythmiacausing tissue Ablation is generally successful When ablation is used for atrial fibrillation it isusually followed by implantation of a pacemaker as wellas drug therapy A pacemaker is a batterypowered device about the size of a matchbox that is surgically implanted near thecollarbone to regulate the heart beat Lead wires threaded to the right side of the heart supply electrical energyto pace the atria and ventricles The implantable cardioverter defibrillator is a treatment for serious arrhythmias The batterypowered device senses an abnormalheart rhythm and automatically provides electricalshocks The shocks suspends heart activity and thenallows the heart to initiate a normal rhythm Wire electrodes on the device are attached to the heart Some ofthe electrodes are attached to the outside of the heartand some are attached to the inside of the heart throughveins The newest implantable cardioverter defibrillators can be implanted in the chest wall and do notrequire open chest surgery These devices weigh lessthan oz and generally last seven or eight years Animplantable cardioverter defibrillator is usually usedwith drug therapy but the amount medication isreduced In maze surgery often the last resort surgeonscreate a maze of stitches sutures that help the heartselectrical impulses travel effectively Most of the drugs used for treatment have poten tial side effects and should be carefully monitored bya doctor The goal of treatment is to control the rateand rhythm of the heart and to prevent the formation of blood clots If the arrhythmia is caused by heartdisease the heart disease will also be treated TheAmerican Heart Association recommends aggressivetreatment A digitalis drug most commonly digoxin is usually prescribed to control the heart rate Digitalis drugs slow the hearts electrical impulses helping to restore the normal rate and rhythm These drugs also increase the ability of the hearts muscular layer to contract and pumpproperly Betablockers and calcium channel blockers can also be used for this purpose Betablockers slow thespeed of electrical impulses through the heart Some calcium channel blockers dampen the hearts response toerratic electrical impulses To prevent blood clots aspirin or warfarin Coumadin is administered Warfarin however haspotential bleeding side effects especially in olderpatients Amiodarone is fairly efffective for atrial flutterThis drug is often able to maintain the hearts properrhythm and can also help control the heart rate when theflutter occurs Prognosis Patients with atrial fibrillation and flutter can live a normal life for many years as long as the arrhythmia iscontrolled and serious blood clots are prevented Prevention Atrial fibrillation and flutter can sometimes be pre vented when the cause can be identified and controlledDepending on the cause prevention could include treating the underlying heart

septal defect is an abnormal opening in the wall separating the left and right upper chambers atriaof the heart Description During the normal development of the fetal heart there is an opening in the wall the septum separatingthe left and right upper chambers of the heart Normallythis opening closes before birth but if it does not thechild is born with a hole between the left and right atriaThis abnormal opening is called an atrial septal defectand causes blood from the left atrium to flow into theright atrium Different types of atrial septal defects can occur and they are classified according to where in the separatingwall they are found The most commonly found atrialseptal defect occurs in the middle of the atrial septumand accounts for about of all atrial septal defectsAbnormal openings can form in the upper and lowerparts of the atrial septum as well Causes and symptoms Abnormal openings in the atrial septum occur dur ing fetal development and are twice as common infemales as in males These abnormalities can go unnoticed if the opening is small producing no abnormalsymptoms If the defect is big large amounts of bloodflowing from the left to the right atrium will cause theright atrium to swell to hold the extra blood People born with an atrial septal defect can have no symptoms through their twenties but by age mostpeople with this condition have symptoms that caninclude shortness of breath rapid abnormal beating of the atria atrial fibrillation and eventually heart failure Diagnosis Atrial septal defects can be identified by various methods Abnormal changes in the sound of the heartbeats can be heard when a doctor listens to the heart witha stethoscope In addition a chest x ray an electrocar diogram ECG an electrical printout of the heartbeatsand an echocardiogram a test that uses sound waves toform a detailed image of the heart can also be used toidentify this condition An atrial septal defect can also be diagnosed by using a test called cardiac catheterization This test involves GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Atrial septal defectGEM to A PM Page inserting a very thin tube catheter into the hearts cham bers to measure the amount of

Treatment Atrial septal defects often correct themselves without medical treatments by the age of two If this dose not happen surgery is done by sewing the hole closed or bysewing a patch of Dacron material or a piece of the sac thatsurrounds the heart the pericardium over the opening Some patients can have the defect fixed by having an clamshaped plug placed over the opening This plug is amanmade device that is put in place through a catheterinserted into the heart Prognosis Individuals with small defects can live a normal life but larger defects require surgical correction Less than

the United States is estimated to affect of children and afflicts boys more often than girlsAlthough difficult to assess in infancy and toddlerhoodsigns of ADHD may begin to appear as early as age twoor three but the symptom picture changes as adolescenceapproaches Many symptoms particularly hyperactivitydiminish in early adulthood but impulsivity and inattention problems remain with up to of ADHD individuals throughout their adult life Children with ADHD have short attention spans becoming easily bored andor frustrated with tasksAlthough they may be quite intelligent their lack of focusfrequently results in poor grades and difficulties in schoolADHD children act impulsively taking action first andthinking later They are constantly moving runningclimbing squirming and fidgeting but often have troublewith gross and fine motor skills and as a result may be GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder ADHDGEM to A PM Page physically clumsy and awkward Their clumsiness may extend to the social arena where they are sometimesshunned due to their impulsive and intrusive behavior Causes and symptoms The causes of ADHD are not known However it appears that heredity plays a major role in the development of ADHD Children with an ADHD parent or sibling are more likely to develop the disorder themselvesBefore birth ADHD children may have been exposed topoor maternal nutrition viral infections or maternal substance abuse In early childhood exposure to lead orother toxins can cause ADHDlike symptoms Traumaticbrain injury or neurological disorders may also triggerADHD symptoms Although the exact cause of ADHD isnot known an imbalance of certain neurotransmittersthe chemicals in the brain that transmit messagesbetween nerve cells is believed to be the mechanismbehind ADHD symptoms A widely publicized study conducted by Dr Ben Feingold in the early s suggested that allergies to certain foods and food additives caused the characteristichyperactivity of ADHD children Although some children may have adverse reactions to certain foods that canaffect their behavior for example a rash might temporarily cause a child to be distracted from other taskscarefully controlled followup studies have uncovered nolink between food allergies and ADHD Another popularly held misconception about food and ADHD is that theconsumption of sugar causes hyperactive behaviorAgain studies have shown no link between sugar intakeand ADHD It is important to note however that a nutritionally balanced diet is important for normal development in allchildren Psychologists and other mental health professionals typically use the criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Sta tistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth EditionDSMIV as a guideline for determining the presence of ADHD For a diagnosis of ADHD DSMIV requires the presence of at least six of the following symptoms ofinattention or six or more symptoms of hyperactivityand impulsivity combined Inattention fails to pay close attention to detail or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork or other activities has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or activities does not appear to listen when spoken to does not follow through on instructions and does not finish tasks has difficulty organizing tasks and activities avoids or dislikes tasks that require sustained mental effort eg homework is easily distracted is forgetful in daily activities Hyperactivity fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat does not remain seated when expected to runs or climbs excessively when inappropriate in ado lescence and adults feelings of restlessness has difficulty playing quietly is constantly on the move talks excessively Impulsivity blurts out answers before the question has been com pleted has difficulty waiting for his or her turn interrupts andor intrudes on others DSMIV also requires that some symptoms develop before age seven and that they significantly impair functioning in two or more settings eg home and schoolfor a period of at least six months Children who meet thesymptom criteria for inattention but not for hyperactivityimpulsivity are diagnosed with AttentionDeficitHyperactivity Disorder Predominantly Inattentive Typecommonly called ADD Young girls with ADHD maynot be diagnosed because they have mainly this subtypeof the disorder Diagnosis The first step in determining if a child has ADHD is to consult with a pediatrician The pediatrician can makean initial evaluation of the childs developmental maturity compared to other children in his or her age groupThe physician should also perform a comprehensivephysical examination to rule out any organic causes of ADHD symptoms such as an overactive thyroid orvision or hearing problems If no organic problem can be found a psychologist psychiatrist neurologist neuropsychologist or learningspecialist is typically consulted to perform a comprehensive ADHD assessment A complete medical familysocial psychiatric and educational history is compiledfrom existing medical and school records and frominterviews with parents and teachers Interviews mayalso be conducted with the child depending on his orher age Along with these interviews several clinicalinventories may also be used such as the Conners Rating Scales Teachers Questionnaire and Parents Ques GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder ADHDGEM to A PM Page tionnaire Child Behavior Checklist CBCL and the Achenbach Child Behavior Rating Scales These inventories provide valuable information on the childs behavior in different settings and situations In addition theWender Utah Rating Scale has been adapted for use indiagnosing ADHD in adults It is important to note that mental disorders such as depression and anxiety disorder can cause symptoms similar to ADHD A complete and comprehensive psychiatric assessment is critical to differentiate ADHDfrom other possible mood and behavioral disordersBipolar disorder for example may be misdiagnosed as ADHD Public schools are required by federal law to offer free ADHD testing upon request A pediatrician can alsoprovide a referral to a psychologist or pediatric specialistfor ADHD assessment Parents should check with theirinsurance plans to see if these services are covered Treatment Psychosocial therapy usually combined with med ications is the treatment approach of choice to alleviateADHD symptoms Psychostimulants such as dextroamphetamine Dexedrine pemoline Cylert and methylphenidate Ritalin are commonly prescribed to controlhyperactive and impulsive behavior and increase attention span They work by stimulating the production ofcertain neurotransmitters in the brain Possible sideeffects of stimulants include nervous tics irregular heartbeat loss of appetite and insomnia However the med ications are usually welltolerated and safe in most cases In children who dont respond well to stimulant ther apy tricyclic antidepressants such as desipramine Norpramin Pertofane and amitriptyline Elavil are frequently recommended Reported side effects of thesedrugs include persistent dry mouth sedation disorien tation and cardiac arrhythmia particularly withdesipramine Other medications prescribed for ADHDtherapy include buproprion Wellbutrin an antidepressant fluoxetine Prozac an SSRI antidepressant andcarbamazepine Tegretol Atretol an anticonvulsantdrug Clonidine Catapres an antihypertensive medication has also been used to control aggression and hyperactivity in some ADHD children although it should not be used with Ritalin A childs response to medicationwill change with age and maturation so ADHD symptoms should be monitored closely and prescriptionsadjusted accordingly Behavior modification therapy uses a reward system to reinforce good behavior and task completion and canbe implemented both in the classroom and at home Atangible reward such as a sticker may be given to the childevery time he completes a task or behaves in an acceptable manner A chart system may be used to display thestickers and visually illustrate the childs progress Whena certain number of stickers are collected the child maytrade them in for a bigger reward such as a trip to the zooor a day at the beach The reward system stays in placeuntil the good behavior becomes ingrained A variation of this technique cognitivebehavioral therapy works to decrease impulsive behavior by get ting the child to recognize the connection betweenthoughts and behavior and to change behavior by changing negative thinking patterns Individual psychotherapy can help an ADHD child build selfesteem give them a place to discuss their worries and anxieties and help them gain insight into theirbehavior and feelings Family therapy may also be ben eficial in helping family members develop coping skillsand in working through feelings of guilt or anger parentsmay be experiencing ADHD children perform better within a familiar consistent and structured routine with positive reinforcements for good behavior and real consequences for badFamily friends and caretakers should all be educated onthe special needs and behaviors of the ADHD childCommunication between parents and teachers is especially critical to ensuring an ADHD child has an appropriate learning environment Alternative treatment A number of alternative treatments exist for ADHD Although there is a lack of controlled studies to provetheir efficacy proponents report that they are successfulin controlling symptoms in some ADHD patients

various sound frequencies The test is performedwith the use of electronic equipment called an audiometer This testing is usually administered by a trained technician called an audiologist Purpose Audiometry testing is used to identify and diagnose hearing loss The equipment is used in health screening programs for example in grade schools to detect hearingproblems in children It is also used in the doctors office orhospital audiology department to diagnose hearing problems in children adults and the elderly With correct diagnosis of a persons specific pattern of hearing impairmentthe right type of therapy which might include hearing aids corrective surgery or speech therapy can be prescribed Precautions Testing with audiometry equipment is simple and painless No special precautions are required Description A trained audiologist a specialist in detecting hear ing loss uses an audiometer to conduct audiometry testing This equipment emits sounds or tones like musicalnotes at various frequencies or pitches and at differingvolumes or levels of loudness Testing is usually done ina soundproof testing room The person being tested wears a set of headphones that blocks out other distracting sounds and delivers atest tone to one ear at a time At the sound of a tone thepatient holds up a hand or finger to indicate that thesound is detected The audiologist lowers the volume andrepeats the sound until the patient can no longer detect itThis process is repeated over a wide range of tones orfrequencies from very deep low sounds like the lowestnote played on a tuba to very high sounds like the pinging of a triangle Each ear is tested separately It is notunusual for levels of sensitivity to sound to differ fromone ear to the other A second type of audiometry testing uses a headband rather than headphones The headband is worn with smallplastic rectangles that fit behind the ears to conduct soundthrough the bones of the skull The patient being testedsenses the tones that are transmitted as vibrations throughthe bones to the inner ear As with the headphones thetones are repeated at various frequencies and volumes The results of the audiometry test may be recorded on a grid or graph called an audiogram This graph isgenerally set up with low frequencies or tones at one endand high ones at the other end much like a piano keyboard Low notes are graphed on the left and high noteson the right The graph also charts the volume of thetones used from soft quiet sounds at the top of the chartto loud sounds at the bottom Hearing is measured inunits called decibels Most of the sounds associated withnormal speech patterns are generally spoken in the rangeof decibels An adult with normal hearing candetect tones between decibels Speech audiometry is another type of testing that uses a series of simple recorded words spoken at variousvolumes into headphones worn by the patient being tested The patient repeats each word back to the audiologistas it is heard An adult with normal hearing will be ableto recognize and repeat of the words GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Audiometry An audiologist conducting a hearing test Custom

Definition Auditory integration training or AIT is one specific type of musicauditory therapy based upon the work ofFrench otolaryngologists Dr Alfred Tomatis and Dr GuyBerard Origins The premise upon which most auditory integration programs are based is that distortion in how things areheard contributes to commonly seen behavioral or learningdisorders in children Some of these disorders includeattention deficithyperactive disorder ADHD autism dyslexia and central auditory processing disordersCAPD Training the patient to listen can stimulate central and cortical organization Auditory integration is one facet of what audiolo gists call central auditory processing The simplest definition of central auditory processing or CAP is University of Buffalo Professor of Audiology Jack Katzs whichis What we do with what we hear Central auditoryintegration is actually the perception of sound includingthe ability to attend to sound to remember it retaining itin both the long and shortterm memory to be able tolisten to sound selectively and to localize it Guy Berard developed one of the programs com monly used Berards auditory integration training consists of twenty halfhour sessions spent listening to musical sounds via a stereophonic system The music is random with filtered frequencies and the person listensthrough earphones These sound waves vibrate and exercise structures in the middle ear This is normally done insessions twice a day for days GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Auditory integration trainingGEM to A PM Page Alfred Tomatis is also the inventor of the Electronic Ear This device operates through a series of filters andreestablishes the dominance of the right ear in hearing Thebasis of Tomatis work is a series of principles that follow The most important purpose of the ear is to adapt sound waves into signals that charge the brain Sound is conducted via both air and bone It can be considered something that nourishes the nervous system either stimulating or destimulating it Just as seeing is not the same as looking hearing is not the same as listening Hearing is passive Listening isactive A persons ability to listen affects all language develop ment for that person This process influences everyaspect of selfimage and social development The capacity to listen can be changed or improved through auditory stimulation using musical and vocalsounds at high frequenciesALFRED TOMATIS Communication begins in the womb As early as the beginning of the second trimester fetuses can hearsounds These sounds literally cause the brain and nervous system of the baby to develop Description A quartet of CAP defects have been identified that can unfavorably alter how each person processes soundAmong these are Phonetic decoding a problem that occurs when the brain incorrectly decodes what is being heard Soundsare unrecognizable often because the person speakingtalks too fast Tolerancefading memory a condition with little or poor tolerance for background sounds Auditory integration involves a persons ability to put together things heard with things seen Characteristical GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Auditory integration training Internationally renowned French otolaryngologist psychologist educator and inventor Alfred Tomatis perceived the importance of sound and hearing early in hiscareer He took his degree as a Doctor of Medicine fromthe University of Paris and specialized in ear nose andthroat medicine The son of two opera singers Tomatisearly in his career treated some of his parents fellow opera singers From these experiences with the sound ofmusic he developed the principle that has come to beknown as the Tomatis Effect ie that the human voice canonly sing what it hears Tomatis has been called the Einstein of the ear It was his research that made the world aware that the ears of aninfant in utero are already functioning at four and halfmonths of age Just as the umbilical cord provides nourishment to the unborn infants body Tomatis postulatedthat the sound of the mothers voice is also a nutrientheard by the fetus This sound literally charges and stimulates the growth of the brain Tomatis took this further into the realm of language Tomatis concluded that the need to communicate and tobe understood are among our most basic needs He was apioneer in perceiving that language problems convert intosocial problems for people Language is what characterizes man and makes him different from other creaturesTomatis is quoted as saying The techniques he developedto teach people how to listen effectively are internationally respected tools used in the treatment of autism attentiondeficit disorder and other learning disabilities His listening program the invention of the Electronic Ear and his work with the therapeutic use of sound andmusic for the past fifty years have made Tomatis arguablythe best known and most successful ear specialist in theworld There are more than two hundred Tomatis Centersworldwide treating a vast variety of problems related tothe ability to hear Photograph by V Brynner Gamma Liaison Reproduced by permissionGEM to A PM Page ly there are long response delays and trouble with phonics or recognizing the symbols for sounds The fourth problem area often called auditory organi zation overlaps the previous three It is characterizedby disorganization in handling auditory and other information Certain audiological tests are carried out to see if the person has a CAP problem and if so how severe it isOther tests give more specific information regarding thenature of the CAP problem They include Puretone airconduction threshold testing which mea sures peripheral hearing loss If loss is found thenboneconduction testing or evaluation of the vibrationof small bones in the inner ear is also carried out Word discrimination scores WDS determines a per sons clarity in hearing ideal speech This is done bypresenting words at decibels above the persons average sound threshold in each ear Test scoresequal the percentage of words heard correctly Immittance testing is made up of two parts assessing the status of and the protective mechanisms of the middle ear Staggered sporadic word SSW testing delivers compound words in an overlapping way at decibelsabove threshold to each ear of the person being testedThis test provides expanded information that makes itpossible to break down CAP problems into the fourbasic types Speech in noise discrimination SN testing is similar to Staggered Sporadic Word testing except that other noiseis also added and the percentage correct in quiet is compared with that correct when there is added noise Phonemic synthesis PS determines serious learning problems The types of errors made in sounding outwritten words or associating written letters with thesounds they represent help in determining the type andseverity of CAP problems Purpose Upon completion of an auditory integration training program the persons hearing should be capable of perceiving all frequencies at or near the same level Totalimprovement from this therapy in both hearing andbehavior can take up to one year Research and general acceptance Auditory integration training is based upon newly learned information about the brain Though brain structures and connections are predetermined probably byheredity another factor called plasticity also comes into play Learning we now know continues from birth todeath Plasticity is the ability of the brain to actuallychange its structuring and connections through theprocess of learning Problems with auditory processing are now viewed as having a widereaching ripple effect on our society Itis estimated that of children starting school havelanguagelearning skills that can be described as poorCAP difficulties are a factor in several different learningdisabilities They affect not only academic success butalso nearly every aspect of

Auditory integration trainingGEM to A PM Page guage together with ritualistic or compulsive behavior and bizarre responses to the environment Description Autism is a lifelong disorder that interferes with the ability to understand what is seen heard and touchedThis can cause profound problems in personal behaviorand in the ability to relate to others A person withautism must learn how to communicate normally andhow to relate to people objects and events Howevernot all patients suffer the same degree of impairmentThere is a full spectrum of symptoms which can rangefrom mild to severe Autism occurs in as many as one or two per children It is found four times more often in boys usually the firstborn and occurs around the world in all racesand social backgrounds Autism usually is evident in thefirst three years of life although in some children itshard to tell when the problem develops Sometimes thecondition isnt diagnosed until the child enters school While a person with autism can have symptoms ranging from mild to severe about have an extraordinary ability in one area such as in mathematics memory music or art Such children are known as autisticsavants formerly known as idiot savants Causes and symptoms Autism is a brain disorder that affects the way the brain uses or transmits information Studies have foundabnormalities in several parts of the brain that almostcertainly occurred during fetal development The problem may be centered in the parts of the brain responsiblefor processing language and information from the senses There appears to be a strong genetic basis for autism Identical twins are more likely to both beaffected than twins who are fraternal not geneticallyidentical In a family with one autistic child thechance of having another child with autism is about in much higher than in the normal populationSometimes relatives of an autistic child have mildbehaviors that look very much like autism such asrepetitive behaviors and social or communication problems Research also has found that some emotional disorders such as manic depression occur more often infamilies of a child with autism At least one group of researchers has found a link between an abnormal gene and autism The gene may bejust one of at least three to five genes that interact insome way to cause the condition Scientists suspect that afaulty gene or genes might make a person vulnerable todevelop autism in the presence of other factors such as achemical imbalance viruses or chemicals or a lack of oxygen at birth In a few cases autistic behavior is caused by a dis ease such as rubella in the pregnant mother tuberous sclerosis fragile X syndrome encephalitis untreated phenylketonuria The severity of the condition varies between individ uals ranging from the most severe extremely unusualrepetitive self injurious and aggressive behavior tovery mild resembling a personality disorder with somelearning disability Profound problems with social interaction are the most common symptoms of autism Infants with the disorder wont cuddle they avoid eye contact and dontseem to want or need physical contact or affection Theymay become rigid or flaccid when they are held cry whenpicked up and show little interest in human contact Sucha child doesnt smile or lift his arms in anticipation ofbeing picked up He forms no attachment to parents norshows any normal anxiety toward strangers He doesnt learn typical games of childhood such as peekaboo Language problems The child with autism may not speak at all if he does it is often in single words He may endlessly repeatwords or phrases that are addressed to him and mayreverse pronouns You go sleep instead of I want togo to sleep Restricted interests and activity Usually a child with autism has many problems playing normally He probably wont act out adultrolesduring play time and instead of enjoying fantasy play hemay simply repeatedly mimic the actions of someoneelse Bizarre behavior patterns are very common amongautistic children and may include complex ritualsscreaming fits rhythmic rocking arm flapping fingertwiddling and crying without tears Autistic childrenmay play with their own saliva feces or urineThey maybe selfdestructive biting their own hands gouging attheir eyes pulling their hair or banging their head Sensory problems The sensory world poses a real problem to many autistic children who seem overwhelmed by their ownsenses A child with autism may ignore objects or GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AutismGEM to A PM Page become obsessed with them continually watching the object or the movement of his fingers over it Many ofthese children may react to sounds by banging their heador flapping fingers Some highfunctioning autistic adultswho have written books about their childhood experiences report that sounds were often excruciatinglypainful to them forcing them to withdraw from theirenvironment or try to cope by withdrawing into their ownworld of sensation and movement Intellectual problems Most autistic children appear to be moderately mental ly retarded They may giggle or cry for no reason have nofear of real danger but exhibit terror of harmless objects Diagnosis There is no medical test for autism Because the symptoms of autism are so varied the condition may goundiagnosed for some time especially in those with mildcases or if other handicaps are also present It may beconfused with other diseases such as fragile X syndrometuberous sclerosis and untreated phenylketonuriaAutism is diagnosed by observing the childs behav ior communication skills and social interactions Medical tests should rule out other possible causes of autisticsymptoms Criteria that mental health experts use todiagnose autism include problems with developing friendships problems with makebelieve or social play endlessly repeated words or strings of words difficulty in carrying on a conversation obsessions with rituals or restricted patterns preoccupation with parts of objects Some children have a few of the symptoms of autism but not enough to be diagnosed with the classical formof the condition Children who have autistic behavior butno problems with language may be diagnosed withAsperger syndrome Children who seem normal at firstbut who begin to show autistic behavior as they get oldermight be diagnosed with childhood disintegrative

own cellscausing tissue destruction Description Autoimmunity is accepted as the cause of a wide range of disorders and it is suspected to be responsible formany more Autoimmune diseases are classified as eithergeneral in which the autoimmune reaction takes placesimultaneously in a number of tissues or organ specific inwhich the autoimmune reaction targets a single organ Autoimmune disorders include the following Systemic lupus erythematosus A general autoim mune disease in which antibodies attack a number ofdifferent tissues The disease recurs periodically and isseen mainly in young and middleaged women Rheumatoid arthritis Occurs when the immune sys tem attacks and destroys the tissues that line bone jointsand cartilage The disease occurs throughout the bodyalthough some joints may be more affected than others Goodpastures syndrome Occurs when antibodies are deposited in the membranes of both the lung and kidneys causing both inflammation of kidney glomerulusglomerulonephritis and lung bleeding It is typically a disease of young males Graves disease Caused by an antibody that binds to specific cells in the thyroid gland causing them tomake excessive amounts of thyroid hormone Hashimotos thyroiditis Caused by an antibody that binds to cells in the thyroid gland Unlike in Gravesdisease however this antibodys action results in lessthyroid hormone being made Pemphigus vulgaris A group of autoimmune disorders that affect the skin Myasthenia gravis A condition in which the immune system attacks a receptor on the surface of muscle cellspreventing the muscle from receiving nerve impulsesand resulting in severe muscle weakness Scleroderma Also called CREST syndrome or pro gressive systemic sclerosis scleroderma affects theconnective tissue Autoimmune hemolytic anemia Occurs when the body produces antibodies that coat red blood cells Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura Disorder in which the immune system targets and destroys bloodplatelets Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis Immune disorders that affect the neuromuscular system Pernicious anemia Disorder in which the immune system attacks the lining of the stomach in such a waythat the body cannot metabolize vitamin B Sjgrens syndrome Occurs when the exocrine glands are attacked by the immune system resulting in excessive dryness Ankylosing spondylitis Immune system induced degeneration of the joints and soft tissue of the spine Vasculitis A group of autoimmune disorders in which the immune system attacks and destroys blood vessels Type I diabetes mellitus May be caused by an anti body that attacks and destroys the islet cells of the pancreas which produce insulin Amyotrophic lateral schlerosis Also called Lou Gehrigs disease An immune disorder that causes thedeath of neurons which leads to progressive loss of muscular control GuillainBarre syndrome Also called infectious polyneuritis Often occurring after an infection or animmunization specifically Swine flu the diseaseaffects the myelin sheath which coats nerve cells Itcauses progressive muscle weakness and paralysis Multiple sclerosis An autoimmune disorder that may involve a virus affects the central nervous system causing loss of coordination and muscle control Causes and symptoms To further understand autoimmune disorders it is helpful to understand the workings of the immune system The purpose of the immune system is to defend thebody against attack by infectious microbes germs andforeign objects When the immune system attacks an invader it is very specifica particular immune systemcell will only recognize and target one type of invaderTo function properly the immune system must not onlydevelop this specialized knowledge of individualinvaders but it must also learn how to recognize andnot destroy cells that belong to the body itself Everycell carries protein markers on its surface that identifiesit in one of two ways what kind of cell it is eg nervecell muscle cell blood cell etc and to whom that cellbelongs These markers are called major histocompatability complexes MHCs When functioning properlycells of the immune system will not attack any othercell with markers identifying it as belonging to the GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Autoimmune disordersGEM to A PM Page body Conversely if the immune system cells do not recognize the cell as self they attach themselves to itand put out a signal that the body has been invadedwhich in turn stimulates the production of substancessuch as antibodies that engulf and destroy the foreignparticles In case of autoimmune disorders the immunesystem cannot distinguish between self cells andinvader cells As a result the same destructive operationis carried out on the bodys own cells that would normally be carried out on bacteria viruses and other suchharmful entities The reasons why immune systems become dys functional in this way is not well understood Howevermost researchers agree that a combination of geneticenvironmental and hormonal factors play into autoimmunity Researchers also speculate that certain mechanisms may trigger autoimmunity First a substance thatis normally restricted to one part of the body and therefore not usually exposed to the immune system isreleased into other areas where it is attacked Secondthe immune system may mistake a component of thebody for a similar foreign component Third cells ofthe body may be altered in some way either by drugsinfection or some other environmental factor so thatthey are no longer recognizable as self to the immunesystem Fourth the immune system itself may be damaged such as by a genetic mutation and therefore cannot function properly Symptoms The symptoms of the above disorders include Systemic lupus erythematosus Symptoms include fever chills fatigue weight loss skin rashes particu larly the classic butterfly rash on the face vasculitispolyarthralgia patchy hair loss sores in the mouth ornose lymphnode enlargement gastric problems andin women irregular periods About half of those whosuffer from lupus develop cardiopulmonary problemsand some may also develop urinary problems Lupuscan also effect the central nervous system causingseizures depression and psychosis Rheumatoid arthritis Initially may be characterized by a lowgrade fever loss of appetite weight loss and a generalized pain in the joints The joint pain then becomes more specific usually beginning in the fingers thenspreading to other areas such as the wrists elbowsknees and ankles As the disease progresses joint function diminishes sharply and deformities occur particularly the characteristic swans neck curling of the fingers Goodpastures syndrome Symptoms are similar to that of iron deficiency anemia including fatigue and pallor Symptoms involving the lungs may range from a cough that produces bloody sputum to outright hemor rhaging Symptoms involving the urinary systeminclude blood in the urine andor swelling Graves disease This disease is characterized by an enlarged thyroid gland weight loss without loss ofappetite sweating heart palpitations nervousness and an inability to tolerate heat Hashimotos thyroiditis This disorder generally dis plays no symptoms Pemphigus vulgaris This disease is characterized by blisters and deep lesions on the skin Myasthenia gravis Characterized by fatigue and mus cle weakness that at first may be confined to certainmuscle groups but then may progress to the point ofparalysis Myasthenia gravis patients often have expressionless faces as well as difficulty chewing and swallowing If the disease progresses to the respiratory system artificial respiration may be required Scleroderma Disorder is usually preceded by Ray nauds phenomenon Symptoms that follow includepain swelling and stiffness of the joints and the skintakes on a tight shiny appearance The digestive systemalso becomes involved resulting in weight loss appetiteloss diarrhea constipation and distention of the abdomen As the disease progresses the heart lungsand kidneys become involved and malignant hyperten sion causes death in approximately of cases Autoimmune hemolytic anemia May be acute or chronic Symptoms include fatigue and abdominal tenderness due to an enlarged spleen Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura Characterized by pinheadsize red dots on the skin unexplainedbruises bleeding from the nose and gums and blood in the stool Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis In polymyositis symptoms include muscle weakness particularly in theshoulders or pelvis that prevents the patient from performing everyday activities In

Diagnosis A number of tests are involved in the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases depending on the particular disease eg blood tests cerebrospinal fluid analysis electromylogram measures muscle function and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain Usually these tests determine the location and extent of damage or involvement They are useful in charting progress of the diseaseand as baselines for treatment The principle tool however for authenticating autoimmune disease is antibody testing Such testsinvolve measuring the level of antibodies found in theblood and determining if they react with specific antigens that would give rise to an autoimmune reaction Anelevated amount of antibodies indicates that a humoralimmune reaction is occurring Since elevated antibodylevels are also seen in common infections they must be ruled out as the cause for the increased antibody levels Antibodies can also be typed by class There are five classes of antibodies and they can be separated in thelaboratory The class IgG is usually associated withautoimmune diseases Unfortunately IgG class antibodies are also the main class of antibody seen in normalimmune responses The most useful antibody tests involve introducing the patients antibodies to samples of his or her own tissue usually thyroid stomach liver and kidney tissue Ifantibodies bind to the self tissue it is diagnostic for anautoimmune disorder Antibodies from a person withoutan autoimmune disorder would not react to self tissue Treatment Treatment of autoimmune diseases is specific to the disease and usually concentrates on alleviating orpreventing symptoms rather than correcting the underlying cause For example if a gland involved in anautoimmune reaction is not producing a hormone suchas insulin administration of that hormone is requiredAdministration of a hormone however will restorethe function of the gland damaged by the autoimmunedisease The other aspect of treatment is controlling the inflammatory and proliferative nature of the immuneresponse This is generally accomplished with two typesof drugs Steroid compounds are used to control inflammation There are many different steroids each havingside effects The proliferative nature of the immuneresponse is controlled with immunosuppressive drugsThese drugs work by inhibiting the replication of cellsand therefore also suppress nonimmune cells leadingto side effects such as anemia Systemic enzyme therapy is a new treatment that is showing results for rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis ankylosing spondylitis and other inflammatory diseases Enzymes combinations of pancreatin trypsinchymotrypsin bromelain and papain help stimulate thebodys own defenses accelerate inflammation in order toreduce swelling and improve circulation and break upthe immune complexes within the bloodstream Symptoms have been reduced using this treatment Other treatments that hold some promise are irradia tion of the spleen and gene

Medically autopsiesdetermine the exact cause and circumstances of deathdiscover the pathway of a disease and provide valuableinformation to be used in the care of the living Whenfoul play is suspected a government coroner or medicalexaminer performs autopsies for legal use This branchof medical study is called forensic medicine Forensicspecialists investigate deaths resulting from violence oroccurring under suspicious circumstances Benefits of research from autopsies include the pro duction of new medical information on diseases such astoxic shock syndrome acquired immunodeficiency

anddocumentation must be made for both medical and legalreasons Some religious groups prohibit autopsies GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE AutopsyGEM to A PM Page Description An autopsy can be described as the examination of a deceased human body with a detailed exam of the persons remains This procedure dates back to the Romanera when few human dissections were performed autopsies were utilized however to determine the cause ofdeath in criminal cases At the beginning of the procedure the exterior body is examined and then the internalorgans are removed and studied Some pathologistsargue that more autopsies are performed than necessaryHowever recent studies show that autopsies can detectmajor findings about a persons condition that were notsuspected when the person was alive And the growingawareness of the influence of genetic factors in diseasehas also emphasized the importance of autopsies Despite the usefulness of autopsies fewer autopsies have been performed in the United States during the pastKEY TERMS Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDSA group of diseases resulting from infection withthe human immunodeficiency virus HIV A person infected with HIV gradually loses immunefunction becoming less able to resist aliments andcancers resulting in eventual death Computed tomography scan CT scan The tech nique used in diagnostic studies of internal bodilystructures in

Magnetic resonance imaging MRI A diagnostic tool that utilizes nuclear magnetic energy in theproduction of images of specific atoms and molecular structures in solids especially human cellstissues and organs Postmortem After death years A possible reason for this decline is concern about malpractice suits on the part of the treating physician Other possible reasons are that hospitals are performing fewer autopsies because of the expense orbecause modern technology such as CT scans and mag netic resonance imaging can often provide sufficient diagnostic information Nonetheless federal regulatorsand pathology groups have begun to establish new guidelines designed to increase the number and quality ofautopsies being performed Many experts are concerned that if the number of autopsies increases hospitals may be forced to chargefamilies a fee for the procedure as autopies are not normally covered by insurance companies or Medicare Yetaccording to several pathologists the benefit of the procedure for families and doctors does justify the cost Inmedical autopsies physicians remain cautious to examine only as much of the body as permitted according tothe wishes of the family It is important to note thatautopsies can also provide peace of mind for thebereaved family in certain situations Preparation If a medical autopsy is being performed written per mission is secured from the family of the deceased Aftercare Once the autopsy has been completed the body is prepared for final arrangements according to the familyswishes Risks There are some risks of disease transmission from the deceased In fact some physicans may refuse to doautopsies on specific patients because of a fear of contracting diseases such as AIDS hepatitis or CreutzfeldJakob disease Normal results In most

on the physical and psychologicalconditions associated with flying and space travel Purpose Since flying airplanes and spacecraft involves great risk and physical demands such as changes in gravityand oxygen pilots and astronauts need medical expertsto protect their safety and the publics safety Description Pressure changes In the United States the Federal Aviation Adminis tration FAA requires all pilots who fly above ft m to be prepared for pressure changes caused bylower oxygen levels at high altitude Pilots must eitherhave a pressurized cabin or access to an oxygen maskWithout these protections they could experience hypoxia or altitude sickness Hypoxia reduces the amount of oxygen in the brain causing such symptoms asdizziness shortness of breath and mental confusion These symptoms could cause the pilot to lose control ofthe plane Hypoxia can be treated with oxygen therapy Rapid altitude increases and decreases can cause pain because there is an air pocket in the middle portion of the ear To equalize pressure in the ear physicians typically advise pilots and passengers to clear their sinusesby plugging their nose and blowing until the eardrumspop Other options include yawning swallowing orchewing gum For people with a cold or a severelyblocked middle ear the use of decongestants antihista mines or nasal sprays may help Without taking steps to equalize pressure the tympanic membrane could rupturecausing hearing loss vertigo dizziness and nausea Gravitys impact Fighter pilots who fly highperformance jets can experience health problems during rapid acceleration andwhen executing tight turns at high speed During thesemoves a pilot experiences extreme gravity conditionsthat can pull blood away from the brain and heart andinto the lower body This can cause the pilot to have tunnel vision or pass out To prevent these potentially deadlysituations the military requires fighter pilots to wear special flight suits or G suits which have compartmentsthat fill with air or fluid to keep blood from pooling inthe lower body Some pilots like the Blue Angels use a technique called the Valsalva Maneuver instead of G suits to pre vent black outs during highperformance flying The Valsalva Maneuver involves grunting and tightening theabdominal muscles to stop blood from collecting in thewrong parts of the body PREVENTIVE CARE Since any routine health problem that affects a pilot could mean the loss of hundreds oflives aviation medicine specialists who work for commercial airlines and the military take special care to educate pilots about proper diet exercise and preventive health tools For example physicians may frequentlyscreen pilots for vision changes caused by glaucoma or cataracts They also will check for hearing loss and encourage the pilot to wear earplugs or headphones tobuffer engine noise To monitor for heart disease physicians will check blood pressure and may order diagnostictests such as an ECG or stress test Motion sickness Many people experience nausea vertigo and disori entation when they first arrive in space This is caused bychanges in the fluid in the inner ear which is sensitive togravity and

allergies asthma anxiety arthritis chronic fatigue syndrome colds colitis constipation depression diabetes flu heart disease hypertension immune problems inflam mation insomnia nervous disorders obesity skin prob lems and ulcers Ayurvedic physicians seek to discover the roots of a disease before it gets so advanced that more radical treatments are necessary Thus Ayurveda seems to be limitedin treating severely advanced conditions traumaticinjuries acute pain and conditions and injuries requiringinvasive surgery Ayurvedic techniques have also been used alongside chemotherapy and surgery to assist patients in recovery and healing Description Origins Ayurvedic medicine originated in the early civiliza tions of India some years ago It is mentioned in the Vedas the ancient religious and philosophi cal texts that are the oldest surviving literature in theworld which makes Ayurvedic medicine the oldest surviving healing system According to the texts Ayurvedawas conceived by enlightened wise men as a system ofliving harmoniously and maintaining the body so thatmental and spiritual awareness could be possible Medical historians believe that Ayurvedic ideas were transported from ancient India to China and were instrumentalin the development of Chinese medicine GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Ayurvedic medicine DEEPAK CHOPRA Deepak Chopra was born in India and studied medi cine

principles produces herbalremedies and conducts research and documentation ofits healing techniques Key ideas To understand Ayurvedic treatment it is necessary to have an idea how the Ayurvedic system views the bodyThe basic life force in the body is prana which is also found in the elements and is similar to the Chinesenotion of chi As Swami Vishnudevananda a yogi and expert put it Prana is in the air but is not the oxygennor any of its chemical constituents It is in food waterand in the sunlight yet it is not vitamin heat or lightrays Food water air etc are only the media throughwhich the prana is carried In Ayurveda there are five basic elements that con tain prana earth water fire air and ether These elements interact and are further organized in the humanbody as three main categories or basic physiologicalprinciples in the body that govern all bodily functionsknown as the doshas The three doshas are vata pitta and kapha Each person has a unique blend of the three doshas known as the persons prakriti which is why Ayurvedic treatment is always individualized InAyurveda disease is viewed as a state of imbalance inone or more of a persons doshas and an Ayurvedicphysician strives to adjust and balance them using avariety of techniquesThe vata dosha is associated with air and ether and in the body promotes movement and lightness Vata people are generally thin and light physically dryskinnedand very energetic and mentally restless When vata isout of balance there are often nervous problems hyperactivity sleeplessness lower back pains and headaches Pitta is associated with fire and water In the body it is responsible for metabolism and digestion Pitta characteristics are mediumbuilt bodies fair skin strongdigestion and good mental concentration Pitta imbalances show up as anger and aggression and stressrelated conditions like gastritis ulcers liver problems and hypertension The kapha dosha is associated with water and earth People characterized as kapha are generally large orheavy with more oily complexions They tend to be slowcalm and peaceful Kapha disorders manifest emotionally as greed and possessiveness and physically as obesityfatigue bronchitis and sinus problems Diagnosis In Ayurvedic medicine disease is always seen as an imbalance in the dosha system so the diagnostic processstrives to determine which doshas are underactive oroveractive in a body Diagnosis is often taken over acourse of days in order for the Ayurvedic physician tomost accurately determine what parts of the body arebeing affected To diagnose problems Ayurvedic physicians often use long questionnaires and interviews todetermine a persons dosha patterns and physical andpsychological histories Ayurvedic physicians also intricately observe the pulse tongue face lips eyes and fingernails for abnormalities or patterns that they believecan indicate deeper problems in the internal systemsSome Ayurvedic physicians also use laboratory tests toassist in diagnosis GALE

reestablish balance and harmony in the bodys systems Usually the firstmethod of treatment involves some sort of detoxificationand cleansing of the body in the belief that accumulatedtoxins must be removed before any other methods oftreatment will be effective Methods of detoxificationinclude therapeutic vomiting laxatives medicated ene masfasting and cleansing of the sinuses Many Ayur vedic clinics combine all of these cleansing methods intointensive sessions known as panchakarma Panchakarma can take several days or even weeks and they are morethan elimination therapies They also include

and prevention Ayurveda recommends yoga as a form of exercise to build strength and health and also advises massage therapy and selfmassage as ways of increasing circulation andreducing stress Yogic breathing techniques and medita tion are also part of a healthy Ayurvedic regimen toreduce stress and improve mental energy Of all treatments though diet is one of the most basic and widely used therapy in the Ayurvedic systemAn Ayurvedic diet can be a very well planned and individualized regimen According to Ayurveda there are sixbasic tastes sweet sour salty pungent bitter and astringent Certain tastes and foods can either calm or aggravate a particular dosha For instance sweet sour andsalty decrease vata problems and increase kapha Soursalty and pungent can increase pitta After an Ayurvedicphysician determines a persons dosha profile they willrecommend a specific diet to correct imbalances andincrease health The Ayurvedic diet emphasizes primarilyvegetarian foods of high quality and freshness tailored tothe season and time of day Cooling foods are eaten inthe summer and heating ones in the winter always withina persons dosha requirements In daily routine the heaviest meal of the day should be lunch and dinner shouldeaten well before bedtime to allow for complete digestion Also eating meals in a calm manner with properchewing and state of mind is important as is

microti is spread to humans through the bite of the tick Ixodes scapularis also called Ixodes dammini Ixodes scapularis called the blacklegged deer tick usu ally feeds on deer and mice A tick picks up the parasitesby feeding on an infected mouse and then passes them onby biting a new host possibly a human To pass on theparasites the tick must be attached to the skin for hours Once in the bloodstream Babesia microti enters a red blood cell reproduces by cell division and destroysthe cell Humans infected with Babesia microti produce antibodies that can be helpful in diagnosing the

orthrough a surgical procedure or injection Bacteremiamay cause no symptoms and resolve without treatmentor it may produce fever and other symptoms of infection In some cases bacteremia leads to septic shock a poten tially lifethreatening condition Causes and symptoms Causes Several types of bacteria live on the surface of the skin or colonize the moist linings of the urinary tractlower digestive tract and other internal surfaces Thesebacteria are normally harmless as long as they are kept incheck by the bodys natural barriers and the immune system People in good health with strong immune systemsrarely develop bacteremia However when bacteria areintroduced directly into the circulatory system especially in a person who is ill or undergoing aggressive medical treatment the immune system may not be able tocope with the invasion and symptoms of bacteremia maydevelop For this reason bacteremia is most common inpeople who are already affected by or being treated forsome other medical problem In addition medical treatment may bring a person in contact with new types ofbacteria that are more invasive than those already residing in that persons body further increasing the likelihood of bacterial infection Conditions which increase the chances of develop ing bacteremia include immune suppression either due to HIV infection or drug therapy antibiotic therapy which changes the balance of bacteri al types in the body prolonged or severe illness alcoholism or other drug abuse malnutrition diseases or drug therapy that cause ulcers in the intestines eg chemotherapy

bacteremia may include fever over F C chills malaise abdominal pain nausea vomiting diarrhea anxiety shortness of breath confusion Not all of these symptoms are usually present In the elderly confusion may be the only prominent symptomBacteremia may lead to septic shock whose symptoms include decreased consciousness rapid heart and breathing rates and multiple organ failures Diagnosis Bacteremia is diagnosed by culturing the blood for bacteria Samples may need to be tested several timesover several hours Blood analysis may also reveal anelevated number of white blood cells Blood

Definition Bad breath sometimes called halitosis is an unpleasant odor of the breath Description Bad breath is likely to be experienced by most adults at least occasionally Bad breath either real or imaginedcan have a significant impact on a persons social andprofessional life Causes and symptoms Bad breath can be caused by a number of problems Oral diseases fermentation of food particles in themouth sinus infections and unclean dentures can allcontribute to mouth odor Many nonoral diseases suchas lung infections kidney failure or severe liver diseasecan also cause bad breath though rarely Many peoplethink that bad breath can originate in the stomach orintestines this is extremely rare The esophagus is usually collapsed and closed and although a belch may carryodor up from the stomach the chance of bad breathbeing caused from air continually escaping from thestomach is remote Cigarette smoke can cause badbreath not only in the cigarette smoker but also in onewho is constantly exposed to secondhand smoke Diagnosis The easiest way to determine if one has bad breath is to ask someone who is trustworthy and discrete This isusually not too difficult Another more private method ofdetermining if one has bad breath is to lick ones wristwait until it dries then smell the area Scraping the reararea of the tongue with a plastic spoon then smelling thespoon is another method one can use to assess bad breathKEY TERMS Halitosis The medical term for bad breath Treatment The most effective treatment of bad breath is to treat the cause Poor oral hygiene can be improved by regular brushing and flossing as well as regular dental checkupsGentle brushing of the tongue should be part of daily oralhygiene In addition to good oral hygiene the judicioususe of mouthwashes is helpful Mouth dryness experienced at night or during fasting or due to certain med ications and medical conditions can contribute to badbreath Dryness can be avoided by drinking adequateamounts of water Chewing gum may be beneficial As mentioned some medications such as some high blood pressure medications can cause dry mouth If this problem is significant a medication change under thesupervision of ones health care provider may improvethe drymouth condition Oral or sinus infections oncediagnosed can be treated medically usually with antibi otics Lung infections and kidney or liver problems will of course need medical treatment Alternative treatment Depending on the cause a multitude of alternative therapeutic remedies can be used For example sinusitis can be treated with steam inhalation of essential oilsandor herbs Prognosis Most bad breath can be treated successfully with good oral hygiene andor medical care Occasionally forpatients who feel that these

Definition Balance is the ability to maintain a position Coordi nation is the capacity to move through a complex set ofmovements Balance and coordination depend on theinteraction of multiple body organs and systems including the eyes ears brain and nervous system cardiovascular system and muscles Tests or examination of anyor all of these organs or systems may be necessary todetermine the causes of loss of balance dizziness or the inability to coordinate movement or activities Purpose Tests of balance and coordination and the examina tion of the organs and systems that influence balance andcoordination can help to identify causes of dizzinessfainting falling or incoordination Precautions Tests for balance and coordination should be con ducted in a safe and controlled area where patients willnot experience injury if they become dizzy or fall Description Assessment of balance and coordination can include discussion of the patients medical history and a complete physical examination including evaluation of the heart head eyes and ears A slow pulse or heart rate orvery low blood pressure may indicate a circulatory system problem which can cause dizziness or fainting During the examination the patient may be asked to rotatethe head from side to side while sitting up or while lyingdown with the head and neck extended over the edge ofthe examination table If these tests produce dizziness ora rapid twitching of the eyeballs nystagmus the patient may have a disorder of the inner ear which isresponsible for maintaining balance An examination of the eyes and ears may also give clues to episodes of dizziness or incoordination Thepatient may be asked to focus on a light or on a distantpoint or object and to look up down left and right moving only the eyes while the eyes are examined Problemswith vision may in themselves contribute to balance andcoordination disturbances or may indicate more seriousproblems of the nervous system or brain function Hear ing loss fluid in the inner ear or ear infection might indicate the cause of balance and coordination problems Various physical tests may also be used A patient may be asked to walk a straight line stand on one footor touch a finger to the nose to help assess balance Thepatient may be asked to squeeze or push against thedoctors hands to squat down to bend over stand ontiptoes or stand on their heels Important aspects ofthese tests include holding positions for a certain number of seconds successfully repeating movements acertain number of times and repeating the test accurately with eyes closed The patients reflexes may alsobe tested For example the doctor may tap on the kneesankles and elbows with a small rubber mallet to testnervous system functioning These tests may reveal GALE

penis Description Balanitis generally affects uncircumcised males These are men who have a foreskin which is the hood of softskin that partially covers the head of the penis In balanitisthe head and foreskin become red and inflamed In circumcised men who lack a foreskin these symptoms only affectthe tip of the penis The condition often occurs due to thefungus Candida albicans the same organism that causes vaginal yeast infections in women Balanitis which is alsoreferred to as balanoposthitis can be caused by a variety ofother fungal or bacterial infections or may occur due to asensitivity reaction to common chemical agents Uncircumcised men are more at risk for balanitis due to the presence of the foreskin The snug fit of theforeskin around the top of the penis tends to create adamp warm environment that encourages the growth ofmicroorganisms Most of the organisms associated withbalanitis are already present on the penis but in verysmall numbers However if the area between the headand foreskin is not cleansed thoroughly on a regularbasis these organisms can multiply and lead to infection Diabetes can increase the risk of developing the con dition Causes and symptoms Balanitis is usually a result of poor hygienefor example neglecting to bathe for several days A failure GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BalanitisGEM to B PM Page to properly wash or rinse the area between the head and foreskin can lead to the development of fungal or bacterial infections that cause the condition In other cases balanitis may occur due to an allergic reaction Some menmay be sensitive to chemicals found in harsh soaps laundry detergents or contraceptive creams Men who contract a sexually transmitted disease STD such as trichimoniasis may also develop symptoms The symptoms of balanitis are limited to the fore skin and head of the penis in circumcised men only thehead is affected These include redness inflammationpain discharge sore or itchy skin and difficulty retract ing the foreskin Diagnosis Balanitis is usually diagnosed based on a brief physi cal examination This may be conducted by your regular health care provider or by a urologist the type of doctorwho specializes in such disorders The doctor may take asample of the discharge if any to determine the nature ofthe possible infection A urine test may be recommendedto evaluate glucose sugar levels in the urine Balanitistreatment is typically covered by medical insurance Treatment The treatment of balanitis depends on the specific cause which can vary from case to case Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections while topical antifungals such as clotrimazole can combat balanitis caused byCandida If an allergic reaction is causing symptoms the goal is to identify the chemical agent responsible Ointments or creams may be used to ease skin irritation No matter what the cause it is important to thor oughly clean the penis on a daily basis in order to alleviate symptoms If the condition keeps occurring or if theinflammation is interfering with urination circumcision may be advised Alternative treatment According to practitioners of alternative medicine certain herbs may be effective in controlling or preventing yeast infectionsa common cause of balanitisThese remedies include garlic calendula and goldenseal Eating yogurt that contains acidophilus may alsohelp to clear up a Candida infection Prognosis Most cases go away quickly once the cause is identi fied and treated However regular bouts of balanitis canresult in urethral strictureKEY TERMS Acidophilus A bacteria

protozoan called Balan tidium coli that infects the digestive tract It is primarily a disease of the tropics although it is also found in coolertemperate climates Most persons with balantidiasis donot exhibit any noticeable symptoms asymptomaticbut a few individuals will develop diarrhea with blood and mucus and an inflamed colon colitis Description Balantidiasis is caused by Balantidium coli a para sitic protozoan that infects the large intestine B coli is GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BalantidiasisGEM to B PM Page the largest and only protozoan having cilia or hairlike structures that is capable of causing disease in humansBalantidiasis occurs most commonly in areas with poorsanitation and in settings where humans live in closecontact with pigs sheep or goats Causes and symptoms Balantidiasis is transmitted primarily by eating food or drinking water that has been contaminated by humanor animal feces containing B coli cysts During its life cycle this organism exists in two very different forms theinfective cyst or capsuled form which cannot move butcan survive outside the human body because of its thickprotective covering and the diseaseproducing form thetrophozoite which although capable of moving cannotsurvive once excreted in the feces and therefore cannotinfect others In the digestive tract the cysts are transported to the intestine where the walls of the cysts are brokenopen by digestive secretions releasing the mobile trophozoites Once released within the intestine the trophozoites multiply by feeding on intestinal bacteria or byinvading the lining of the large intestine Within the liningof the large intestine the trophozoites secrete a substancethat destroys intestinal tissue and creates sores ulcers orabscesses Trophozoites eventually form new cysts thatare carried through the digestive tract and excreted in thefeces Under favorable temperature and humidity conditions the cysts can survive in soil or water for weeks tomonths ready to begin the cycle again Most individuals with balantidiasis have no notice able symptoms Even though these individuals may notfeel ill they are still capable of infecting others by persontoperson contact or by contaminating food or waterwith cysts that others may ingest for example by preparing food with unwashed hands The most common symptoms of balantidiasis are chronic diarrhea or severe colitis with abdominal crampspain and bloody stools Complications may include intestinal perforation in which the intestinal wallbecomes torn but the organisms do not spread to otherparts of the body in the blood stream Diagnosis Diagnosis of balantidiasis as with other similar dis eases can be complicated partly because symptoms mayor may not be present A diagnosis of balantidiasis may beconsidered when a patient has diarrhea combined with apossible history of recent exposure to amebiasis through travel contact with infected persons or anal intercourse Specifically a diagnosis of balantidiasis is made by finding B coli cysts or trophozoites in the patients stoolsor by finding trophozoites in tissue samples biopsy taken from the large bowel A diagnostic blood test hasnot yet been developed Stool examination This test involves microscopically examining a stool sample for the presence of cysts andor trophozoites of B coli Sigmoidoscopy To take a tissue sample from the large intestine a procedure called a sigmoidoscopy is performed During a sigmoidoscopy a thin flexible instrument is used tovisually examine the intestinal lining and obtain smalltissue specimens Treatment Patients with balantidiasis are treated with prescrip tion medication typically consisting of a ten day courseof either tetracycline or metronidazole Alternative drugsthat have proven effective in treating balantidiasisinclude iodoquinol or paromomycin Prognosis Although somewhat dependent on the patients over all health in general the prognosis for most patients withbalantidiasis is good Severely infected patients occasionally die as a result of a tear in the intestinal wallintestinal perforation and consequent loss of blood Prevention There are no immunization procedures or medica tions that can be taken prior to potential exposure to prevent balantidiasis Moreover people who have had thedisease can become reinfected Prevention requires effective personal and community hygiene Specific safeguards include the following Purification of drinking water Water can be purified by filtering boiling or treatment with iodine Proper food handling Measures include protecting food from contamination by flies cooking food properly washing ones hands after using the bathroom andbefore cooking or eating and avoiding foods that cannot be cooked or peeled when traveling in countrieswith high rates of balantidiasis Careful disposal of human feces Monitoring the contacts of balantidiasis patients The stools of family members and sexual partners of infected persons should be tested for

microscopic organism such as B coli that is eukaryotic and therefore different from bacteria prokaryotic Sigmoidoscopy A procedure in which a thin flexible lighted instrument called a sigmoidoscope is used to visually examine the lower partof the large intestinePurpose There are four valves in the heart which are located at the exit of each of the four chambers of the heart Theyare called aortic valve pulmonary valve mitral valveand tricuspid valve The valves open and close to regulate the blood flow from one chamber to the next Theyare vital to the efficient functioning of the heart In some people the valves are too narrow a condi tion called stenosis Balloon valvuloplasty is performedon children and adults to improve valve function andblood flow by enlarging the valve opening It is a treatment for aortic mitral and pulmonary stenosis Balloonvalvuloplasty has the best results as a treatment for narrowed pulmonary valves Results in treating narrowingof the mitral valve are generally good It is more difficultto perform and less successful in treating narrowing ofthe aortic valve Description Balloon valvuloplasty is a procedure in which a thin tube catheter that has a small deflated balloon at the tipis inserted through the skin in the groin area into a bloodvessel and then is threaded up to the opening of the narrowed heart valve The balloon is inflated which stretches the valve open This procedure cures many valveobstructions It is also called balloon enlargement of anarrowed heart valve The procedure is performed in a cardiac catheteriza tion laboratory and takes up to four hours The patient is usually awake but is given local anesthesia to make the areawhere the catheter is inserted numb After the site where thecatheter will be inserted is prepared and anesthetized thecardiologist inserts a catheter into the appropriate blood vessel then passes a balloontipped catheter through the firstcatheter Guided by a video monitor and an x ray the physician slowly threads the catheter into the heart The deflatedballoon is positioned in the valve opening then is inflatedrepeatedly The inflated balloon widens the valves openingby splitting the valve leaflets apart Once the valve iswidened the balloontipped catheter is removed The othercatheter remains in place for to hours because in somecases the procedure must be repeated Preparation For at least six hours before balloon valvuloplasty the patient will have to avoid eating or drinking anythingAn intravenous line is inserted so that medications can beadministered The patients groin area is shaved andcleaned with an antiseptic About an hour before the procedure the patient is given an oral sedative such asdiazepam Valium GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Balloon valvuloplastyGEM to B PM Page Aftercare After balloon valvuloplasty the patient is sent to the recovery room for several hours where he or she is monitored for vital signs such as pulse and breathing and heartsounds An

insertionsite which will be covered by a sandbag is observed forbleeding until the catheter is removed Intravenous fluidswill be given to help eliminate the xray dye intravenousblood thinners or other medications to dilate the coronaryarteries may be given Pain medication is available For at least minutes after removal of the catheter direct pressure is applied to the site of insertion after thisa pressure dressing will be applied Following dischargefrom the hospital the patient can usually resume normalactivities After balloon valvuloplasty lifelong followupis necessary because valves sometimes degenerate ornarrowing recurs making surgery necessary Risks Balloon valvuloplasty can have serious complica tions For example the valve can become misshapen sothat it doesnt close

dur ing major brain surgery such as the removal of arteri ovenous malformations or aneurysms Coma may also be induced to control intracranial hypertension caused by brain injury Precautions Barbiturateinduced comas are used when conven tional therapy to reduce intracranial hypertension hasfailed Barbiturate dosing is geared toward burst suppressionthat is reducing brain activity as

seizures Purpose Barbiturates are in the group of medicines known as central nervous system depressants CNS Also known as sedativehypnotic drugs barbiturates make people veryrelaxed calm and sleepy These drugs are sometimesused to help patients relax before surgery Some may alsobe used to control seizures convulsions Although barbiturates have been used to treat nervousness and sleepproblems they have generally been replaced by othermedicines for these purposes These medicines may become habit forming and should not be used to relieve everyday anxiety and ten sion or to treat sleeplessness over long periods Description Barbiturates are available only with a physicians prescription and are sold in capsule tablet liquid andinjectable forms Some commonly used barbiturates arephenobarbital Barbita and secobarbital Seconal Recommended dosage Recommended dosage depends on the type of barbi turate and other factors such as the patients age and thecondition for which the medicine is being taken Checkwith the physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for the correct dosage Always take barbiturates exactly as directed Never take larger or more frequent doses and do not take thedrug for longer than directed If the medicine does notseem to be working even after taking it for severalweeks do not increase the dosage Instead check withthe physician who prescribed the medicine Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly without first checking with the physician who prescribed it Itmay be necessary to taper down gradually to reduce thechance of withdrawal symptoms If it is necessary to stoptaking the drug check with the physician for instructionson how to stop Precautions See a physician regularly while taking barbiturates The physician will check to make sure the medicine isworking as it should and will note unwanted side effectsBecause barbiturates work on the central nervous system they may add to the effects of alcohol and otherdrugs that slow the central nervous system such as anti histamines cold medicine allergy medicine sleep aids medicine for seizures tranquilizers some pain relievers and muscle relaxants They may also add to the effects of anesthetics including those used for dental procedures The combined effects of barbiturates and alcoholor other CNS depressants drugs that slow the centralnervous system can be very dangerous leading tounconsciousness or even death Anyone taking barbitu rates should not drink alcohol and should check with hisor her physician before taking any medicines classifiedas

intestine There are two types of this testthe singlecontrast technique where barium sulfate isinjected into the rectum in order to gain a profile view ofthe large intestine and the doublecontrast or air contrast technique where air is inserted into the rectum Purpose A barium enema may be performed for a variety of reasons including to aid in the diagnosis of colon andrectal cancer or colorectal cancer and inflammatory disease Detection of polyps a benign growth in the tissue lining of the colon and rectum diverticula a pouchpushing out from the colon and structural changes inthe large intestine can also be established with this testThe doublecontrast barium enema is the best method fordetecting small tumors such as polyps early inflammatory disease and bleeding caused by ulcers The decision to perform a barium enema is based on a persons history of altered bowel habits These can includediarrhea constipation any lower abdominal pain they are currently exhibiting blood mucus or pus in theirstools It is also recommended that this exam be used everyfive to years to screen healthy people for colorectal cancer the second most deadly type of tumor in the UnitedStates Those who have a close relative with colorectal cancer or have had a precancerous polyp are considered to be GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Barium enemaGEM to B PM Page at an increased risk for the disease and should be screened more frequently to look for abnormalities Precautions While barium enema is an effective screening method in the detection of symptoms and may lead to atimely diagnosis of several diseases it is not the onlymethod to do this As of some studies have shownthat the colonoscopy procedure performed by experi enced gastroenterologists is a more accurate initial diagnostic tool for detecting early signs of colorectal cancerA colonoscopy is the most accurate way for the physician to examine the entire colon and rectum for polyps Ifabnormalities are seen at this time the procedure isaccompanied by a biopsy Some physicians use sigmoi doscopy plus a barium enema instead of colonoscopy Description To begin a barium enema the patient will lie with their back down on a tilting radiographic table in order tohave x rays of the abdomen taken After being assisted toa different position a welllubricated rectal tube is inserted through the anus This tube allows the physician orassistant to slowly administer the barium into the intestine While this filling process is closely monitored it isimportant for the patient to keep the anus tightly contracted against the rectal tube to help maintain its position and prevent the barium from leaking This step isemphasized to the patient due to the inaccuracy that maybe caused if the barium leaks A rectal balloon may alsobe inflated to help retain the barium The table may betilted or the patient moved to a different position to aid inthe filling process As the barium fills the intestine x rays of the abdomen are taken to distinguish significant findingsThere are manyways to perform a barium enema One way is that shortlyafter filling the rectal tube is removed and the patientexpels as much of the barium as possible Upon completingthis an additional x ray is taken and a doublecontrast enema may follow If this is done immediately a thinfilm of barium will remain in the intestine and air isthen slowly injected to expand the bowel lumenSometimes no x rays will be taken until after the air isinjected Preparation In order to conduct the most accurate barium enema test the patient must follow a prescribed diet and bowelpreparation instructions prior to the test This preparationcommonly includes restricted intake of diary productsand a liquid diet for hours prior to the test in additionto drinking large amounts of water or clear liquids hours before the test Patients may also be given laxa tives and asked to give themselves a cleansing enema In addition to the prescribed diet and bowel prepara tion prior to the test the patient can expect the followingduring a barium enema They will be well draped with a gown as they are secured to a tilting xray table As the barium or air is injected into the intestine they may experience cramping pains or the urge to defecate The patient will be instructed to take slow deep breaths through the mouth to ease any discomfort Aftercare Patients should follow several steps immediately after undergoing a barium enema including Drink plenty of fluids to help counteract the dehydrat ing effects of bowel preparation and the test Take time to rest A barium enema and the bowel prepa ration taken before it can be exhausting A cleansing enema may be given to eliminate any remaining barium Lightly colored stools will be prevalent for the next hours following the test Risks While a barium enema is considered a safe screen ing test used on a routine basis it can cause complications in certain people The following indications shouldbe kept in mind before a barium enema is performed Those who have a rapid heart rate severe ulcerative colitis toxic megacolon or a presumed perforation in the intestine should not undergo a barium enema The test can be cautiously performed if the patient has a blocked intestine ulcerative colitis diverticulitis orsevere bloody diarrhea Complications that may be caused by the test include perforation of the colon water intoxication bariumgranulomas inflamed nodules and allergic reactionThese are all very rare Normal results When the patient undergoes a singlecontrast enema their intestine is steadily filled with barium to differentiate the colons markings A normal result displays uniform filling of the colon As the barium is expelled theintestinal walls collapse A normal result on the x rayafter defecation will show the intestinal lining as havinga standard feathery appearance GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Barium enemaGEM to B PM Page Accordingly the doublecontrast enema expands the intestine which is

connection to Oroya fever wasunknown In a young medical researcher DanielCarrion inoculated himself with blood from a lesion tostudy the course of the skin disease When he became illwith Oroya fever the connection became apparentOroya fever is often called Carrions disease in honor ofhis fatal experiment The bacteria Bartonella bacilliformis was isolated by Alberto Barton in but wasnt identified

Bedwetting Definition Bedwetting is the unintentional involuntary dis charge of urine during the night Although most childrenbetween the ages of three and five begin to stay dry atnight the age at which children are physically and emotionally ready to maintain complete bladder controlvaries Enuresis is a technical term that refers to the continued usually involuntary passage of urine during thenight or the day after the age at which control is expected Description Most children wet the bed occasionally and defini tions of the age and frequency at which bedwettingbecomes a medical problem vary somewhat Manyresearchers consider bedwetting normal until age GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BedwettingGEM to B PM Page About of yearold children wet the bed about once a month More boys than girls have this problemThe American Psychiatric Association however definesenuresis as repeated voiding of urine into the bed orclothes at age five or older The wetting is usually involuntary but in some cases it is intentional For a diagnosisof enuresis wetting must occur twice a week for at leastthree months with no underlying physiological causeEnuresis both nighttime nocturnal and daytime diurnal at age five affects of boys and of girls Byage it affects of boys and of girls only ofadolescents experience enuresis Enuresis is divided into two classes A child with primary enuresis has never established bladder control Achild with secondary enuresis begins to wet after a prolonged dry period Some children have both nocturnaland diurnal enuresis Causes and symptoms The causes of bedwetting are not entirely known It tends to run in families Most children with primary enuresis have a close relativea parent aunt or unclewhoalso had the disorder About of children with two parents who wet the bed will also wet the bed Twin studieshave shown that both of a pair of identical twins experienceenuresis more often than both of a pair of fraternal twins Sometimes bedwetting can be caused by a serious medical problem like diabetes sicklecell anemia orepilepsy Snoring and episodes of interrupted breathing during sleep sleep apnea occasionally contribute to bedwetting problems Enlarged adenoids can causethese conditions Other physiological problems such asurinary tract infection severe constipation or spinal cord injury can cause bedwetting Children who wet the bed frequently may have a smaller than normal functional bladder capacity Functional bladder capacity is the amount of urine a personcan hold in the bladder before feeling a strong urge tourinate When functional capacity is small the bladderwill not hold all the urine produced during the nightTests have shown that bladder size in these children isnormal Nevertheless they experience frequent strongurges to urinate Such children urinate often during thedaytime and may wet several times at night Although asmall functional bladder capacity may be caused by adevelopmental delay it may also be that the childs habitof voiding frequently slows bladder development Parents often report that their bedwetting child is an extremely sound sleeper and difficult to wake Howeverseveral research studies found that bedwetting childrenhave normal sleep patterns and that bedwetting canoccur in any stage of sleepRecent medical research has found that many chil dren who wet the bed may have a deficiency of an important hormone known as antidiuretic hormone ADHADH helps to concentrate urine during sleep hoursmeaning that the urine contains less water and thereforetakes up less space This decreased volume of water usually prevents the childs bladder from overfilling duringthe night unless the child drank a lot just before going tobed Testing of many bedwetting children has shownthat these children do not have the usual increase in ADHduring sleep Children who wet the bed therefore oftenproduce more urine during the hours of sleep than theirbladders can hold If they do not wake up the bladderreleases the excess urine and the child wets the bed Research demonstrates that in most cases bedwet ting does not indicate that the child has a physical or psychological problem Children who wet the bed usuallyhave normalsized bladders and have sleep patterns thatare no different from those of nonbedwetting childrenSometimes emotional stress such as the birth of a sib ling a death in the family or separation from the family may be associated with the onset of bedwetting in a previously toilettrained child Daytime wetting howevermay indicate that the problem has a physical cause While most children have no longterm problems as a result of bedwetting some children may develop psychological problems Low selfesteem may occur whenthese children who already feel embarrassed are furtherhumiliated by angry or frustrated parents who punishthem or who are overly aggressive about toilet trainingThe problem can by aggravated when playmates tease orwhen social activities such as sleepaway camp areavoided for fear of teasing Diagnosis If a child continues to wet the bed after the age of six parents may feel the need to seek evaluation anddiagnosis by the family doctor or a childrens specialistpediatrician Typically before the doctor can make adiagnosis a thorough medical history is obtained Thenthe child receives a physical examination appropriate laboratory tests including a urine test urinalysis and if necessary radiologic studies such as x rays If the child is healthy and no physical problem is found which is the case of the time the doctor may not recommend treatment but rather may provide the parents andthe child with reassurance information and advice Treatment Occasionally a doctor will determine that the prob lem is serious enough to require treatment Standard GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BedwettingGEM to B PM Page treatments for bedwetting include bladder training exercises motivational therapy drug therapy psychotherapy and diet therapy Bladder training exercises are based on the theory that those who wet the bed have small functional bladdercapacity Children are told to drink a large quantity ofwater and to try to prolong the periods between urinations These exercises are designed to increase bladdercapacity but are only successful in resolving bedwettingin a small number of patients In motivational therapy parents attempt to encour age the child to combat bedwetting but the child mustwant to achieve success Positive reinforcement such aspraise or rewards for staying dry can help improve selfimage and resolve the condition Punishment for wetnights will hamper the childs selfesteem and compoundthe problem The following motivational techniques are common ly used Behavior modification This method of therapy is aimed at helping children take responsibility for theirnighttime bladder control by teaching new behaviorsFor example children are taught to use the bathroombefore bedtime and to avoid drinking fluids after dinner While behavior modification generally producesgood results it is longterm treatment Alarms This form of therapy uses a sensor placed in the childs pajamas or in a bed pad This sensor triggersan alarm that wakes the child at the first sign of wetness If the child is awakened he or she can then go tothe bathroom and finish urinating The intention is tocondition a response to awaken when the bladder isfull Bedwetting alarms require the motivation of bothparents and children They are considered the mosteffective form of treatment now available A number of drugs are also used to treat bedwetting These medications are usually fast acting children oftenrespond to them within the first week of treatment Amongthe drugs commonly used are a nasal spray of desmopressin acetate DDA VP a substance similar to the hormone that helps regulate urine production and imipraminehydrochloride a drug that helps to increase bladder capacity Studies show that imipramine is effective for as manyas of patients However children often wet the bedagain after the drug is discontinued and it has some sideeffects Some bedwetting with an underlying physicalcause can be treated by surgical procedures These causesinclude enlarged adenoids that cause sleep apnea physicaldefects in the urinary system or a spinal tumor Psychotherapy is indicated when the child exhibits signs of severe emotional distress in response to eventssuch as a death in the family the birth of a new child a change in schools or divorce Psychotherapy is also indicated if a child shows signs of persistently low selfesteem or depression In rare cases allergies or intolerances to certain foodssuch as dairy products citrus products or chocolatecan cause bedwetting When children have foodsensitivities bedwetting may be helped by discoveringthe substances that trigger the allergic response and eliminating these substances from the childs diet Alternative treatment A number of alternative treatments are available for bedwetting Massage According to practitioners of this technique pres sure applied to various points on the body may help alleviate the condition Acupressure or massage when done by a trained therapist may also be helpful in bedwettingcaused by a neurologic problem Herbal and homeopathic remedies Some herbal remedies such as horsetail Equisetum arvense have also been used to treat bedwetting A trained homeopathic practitioner working at the constitutional level will seek to rebalance the childs vitalforce eliminating the imbalanced behavior of bedwetting Common homeopathic remedies used in this treatment include Causticum Lycopodium and Pulsatilla Hypnosis Hypnosis is another approach that is being used suc cessfully by practitioners trained in this therapy It trainsthe child to awaken and go to the bathroom when his orher bladder feels full Hypnosis is less expensive lesstimeconsuming and less dangerous than mostapproaches it has virtually no

deprived of oxygen andnutrients for as little as an hour areas of tissue can dieand bedsores can formSlight rubbing or friction against the skin can cause minor pressure ulcers They can also develop when apatient stretches or bends blood vessels by slipping into adifferent position in a bed or chair Urine feces or other moisture increases the risk of skin infection and people who are unable to move or recognize internal cues to shift position have a greater thanaverage risk of developing bedsores Other risk factors include malnutrition anemia lack of red blood cells diuse atrophy muscle

thecentral nervous system These symptoms include ulcerationof the mouth or the genital area skin lesions and inflam mation of the uvea an area around the pupil of the eye Description Behcets syndrome is a chronic disease that involves multiple body systems The disease is named for a Turkish dermatologist Hulusi Behcet who first reported apatient with recurrent mouth and genital ulcers alongwith uveitis in The disease occurs worldwide but is most prevalent in Japan the Middle East and in theMediterranean region There is a wider prevalenceamong males than females in a ratio of two to one Causes and symptoms The cause of Behcets syndrome is unknown Symp toms include recurring ulcers in the mouth or the genitalarea skin lesions arthritis that affects mainly the kneesand ankles pain and irritation in the eyes and fever The mouth and genital ulcers tend to occur in multiples andcan be quite painful In the mouth these ulcers are generally found on the tongue gums and the inside of the lipsor jaws In the genital area the ulcers usually occur onthe penis and scrotum in males and on the vulva ofwomen The eye inflammation can lead to blindness Diagnosis Because Behcets syndrome is a multisystem disease it is difficult to diagnose International criteria have beenproposed to assist in classifying this disease There is noone diagnostic feature of this disease so diagnosis dependson grouping together enough symptoms in order to identifythe disease Symptoms of Behcets syndrome also occur inother diseases so it is often necessary to rule out the otherdiseases before a definitive diagnosis can be reached Treatment Some of the current drugs used to treat Behcets syn drome include corticosteroids cyclosporin azathioprine chlorambucil interferon alpha thalidomide levamisole pulse cyclophosphamide cyclosporine Prognosis The prognosis for Behcets syndrome is generally poor There has been a documented case of Behcets lasting for years Although the disease is consideredpainful but not fatal when the central nervous system isinvolved there is usually severe disability and death often occurs The condition is usually chronic althoughthere can be remissions during the course of the

symptoms Causes and symptoms Treponema pallidum the bacteria that causes bejel is very closely related to the one that causes the sexuallytransmitted form of syphilis but transmission is very different In bejel transmission is by direct contact withbroken skin or contaminated hands or indirectly by sharing drinking vessels and eating utensils T pallidum is passed on mostly between children living in poverty invery unsanitary environments and with poor hygiene The skin bones and mucous membranes are affect ed by bejel Patches and ulcerated sores are common inthe mouth throat and nasal passages Gummy lesionsmay form even breaking through the palate Other findings may include a region of swollen lymph nodes anddeep bone pain in the legs Eventually bones may become deformed Diagnosis

may be unable to close the eye on theaffected side of the face and may also experience tearing drooling and hypersensitive hearing The onset canbe quite sudden sometimes occurring overnightAlthough Bells palsy is unsettling and inconvenient it istypically not indicative of a serious health problem Theweakness and paralysis resolve completely in the majority of cases Description Bells palsy has been described as a diagnosis of exclusion because several other disorders present similarKEY TERMS Endemic disease An infectious disease that occurs frequently in a specific geographicallocale The disease often occurs in cycles Influenza is an example of an endemic disease Lymph This is a clear colorless fluid found in lymph vessels and nodes The lymph nodes contain organisms that destroy bacteria and other disease causing organisms also called pathogens Syphilis This disease occurs in two forms One is a sexually transmitted disease caused by a bacteria The second form is not sexually transmittedbut passed on by direct contact with the patient orthrough use of shared food dishes and utensilssymptoms Facial palsies have been linked to conditions such as Lyme disease ear infection meningitis syphilis German measles rubella mumps chicken pox varicella and infection with EpsteinBarr virus eg infectious mononucleosis True Bells palsy is an idiopathic facial palsy meaning the root cause cannot beidentified Although Bells palsy is not lifethreatening itcan present symptoms similar to truly serious conditionssuch as a stroke ruptured aneurysm or tumors Every year approximately Americans are stricken with Bells palsy Worldwide there is anannual incidence of cases per individualsAn individual can be affected at any age but young andmiddleaged adults are the most likely to be affected It isunusual to see Bells palsy in people less than yearsold Bells palsy can affect either side of the face and neither gender seems to be at a greater risk Pregnant womenand individuals with diabetes influenza a cold or an upper respiratory infection seem to be at a greater riskAlthough it cannot be considered a serious condition froma health standpoint it can cause extreme stress embar rassment and inconvenience for those affected In the large majority of cases the facial weakness or paralysis is temporary However individualswho experience complete paralysis seem to have a poorerrecovery rate with only returning to normal Approximately of all Bells palsy cases result in permanentfacial deformity and another experience permanent problems with spasms twitching or contracted muscles Between and of individuals who haveexperienced Bells palsy will have a recurrence On average the first recurrence happens years after the firstepisode the second years later One recurrence isvery infrequent and a second is extremely rare Causes and symptoms The symptoms of Bells palsy arise from an inflam mation or swelling of the seventh cranial nerve otherwise called the facial nerve Both sides of the face have afacial nerve which controls the muscles on that side ofthe face The course of the facial nerve passes through abony canal in the skull When the nerve becomesswollen it is compressed since the canal does not allowfor any expansion As further swelling increases the compression nerve signal conduction is impeded or evenprevented The interference with the nerve signals is seenin the loss of muscle control and tone Why the facial nerve becomes inflamed in Bells palsy is a matter of some debate and medical researchersand doctors are not in complete agreement The bestsupported evidence implicates the herpes simplex virusHSV which is responsible for cold sores and fever GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bells palsyGEM to B PM Page blisters HSV infection has been discovered in up to of Bells palsy cases Most people harbor this virusalthough they may not exhibit symptoms The major symptom of Bells palsy is onesided facial weakness or paralysis Muscle control is eitherinadequate or completely missing There may also beinvoluntary facial movements such as twitches thataccompany certain facial expressions Afflicted individuals frequently have difficulty shutting the affected eyeand may not be able to close it at all Diagnosis Although Bells palsy is not lifethreatening it shares symptoms in common with serious conditionssuch as stroke Therefore emergency medical attention isa wise and necessary precaution Bells palsy affects thefacial nerve unlike most strokes associated with facialweakness which affect higher nerve centers ultimatelysupplying the facial nerve These two disorders can bedistinquished clinically because most strokes do notcause weakness of the forehead or eyelid muscles The fact that Bells palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion becomes apparent in the course of the medical examinationthe usual mode of examination is to rule out other disorders until only Bells palsy is left Disorders thatneed to be excluded include demyelinating disease egmultiple sclerosis stroke tumors bacterial or viral infection and bone fracture During the physical examination the afflicted indi vidual is asked about recent illnesses accidents infections and any other symptoms A visual exam of theears throat and sinus is done and hearing is tested Theextent of the symptoms is assessed by grading the symmetry of the face at rest and during voluntary movements such as wrinkling the forehead puckering thelips and closing the affected eye Involuntary movements are assessed in combination with the voluntarymovements Neurologic exam is done to rule out involvement of other parts of the nervous system exceptfor the facial muscles which would exclude the diagnosis of Bells palsy In response to the individuals medical history blood tests and possibly a cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis are ordered The results of these tests help determine the presence of a bacterial or viral infection oran inflammatory disease Electrophysiological tests inwhich a muscle or nerve is artificially stimulated may beused to assess the condition of facial muscles and thefacial nerve Common tests include electromyography which measures voluntary muscle movement and nerveconduction velocity which determines the extent ofnerve degeneration Radiological tests may also beincluded such as an x ray as well as imaging tests suchas magnetic resonance imaging MRI and computed tomography These testsespecially MRIallow anexcellent view of the nerve itself Once all other possibilities are exhausted a diagno sis of Bells palsy is made The following weeks are aperiod of watchful waiting Further examinations aredone to track recovery Results from nerve conductiontests may be used to predict an outcome However thisuse is questioned by some doctors and medicalresearchers since evidence for their predictive value isinconclusive If facial movement even a small amount has not returned within months the diagnosis of Bells palsymay need to be reevaluated Treatment Many doctors prescribe an antiviral andor a steroid for Bells palsy but there is some controversy aboutwhether these drugs actually help The consensus opinion seems to be that although drugs might not be necessary they are not dangerous and they may help in some GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bells palsy This boys facial paralysis was caused by a tickborne meningopadiculitis Photo Researchers Inc Reproduced by permissionGEM to B PM Page cases especially if there is complete paralysis If drugs are used they need to be taken as soon as possible following the onset of symptoms Antiviral drugs such as acyclovir famciclovir or valacyclovir are prescribed todestroy actively replicating viruses and prevent furtherdamage to the facial nerve Steroids such as prednisoneare thought to be useful in reducing swelling and therefore compression on the nerve In the past surgery was performed to relieve the compression on the nerve However this treatmentoption is now used very infrequently because it does notguarantee recovery and it carries the risk of permanentnerve damage The need to protect the affected eye is universally promoted Since the individual may not be able to lowerthe affected eyelid the eye may become dry particularlyat night Excessive dryness can damage the cornea Daytime treatment includes artificial tears and may includean eye patch or other protective measures Nighttimetreatment involves a more intense effort at keeping theeye protected Eye lubricants or viscous ointments alongwith taping the eye shut are frequently recommended In cases of permanent nerve damage cosmetic treat ment options such as therapeutic injections of botulism toxin or surgery may be sought or suggested Alternative treatment Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine have historically used acupuncture to treat Bells palsy There are also some indications that facial massage and chiro practic manipulation may help treat the symptoms and improve the outcome There are also claims of therapeutic value for local injections or ingestion of vitamin B supplements Prognosis Most individuals with Bells palsy begin to notice improvement in their condition within weeks of thesymptoms onset At least of them will be fully recovered within three months Among the other of afflicted individuals symptoms may take longer to resolve orthey may be permanent Individuals suffering permanentnerve damage may not regain control of the muscles onthe affected side of the face These muscles may remainweak or paralyzed If the nerve

tension and other symptoms by slowing thecentral nervous system Purpose Benzodiazepines are a type of antianxiety drugs While anxiety is a normal response to stressful situa tions some people have unusually high levels of anxietythat can interfere with everyday life For these peoplebenzodiazepines can help bring their feelings under control The medicine can also relieve troubling symptomsof anxiety such as pounding heartbeat breathing problems irritability nausea and faintness Physicians may sometimes prescribe these drugs for other conditions such as muscle spasms epilepsy andother seizure disorders phobias panic disorder with drawal from alcohol and sleeping problems Howeverthis medicine should not be used every day for sleepproblems that last more than a few days If used this waythe drug loses its effectiveness within a few weeks Benzodiazepines should not be used to relieve the nervousness and tension of normal everyday life Description The family of antianxiety drugs known as benzodi azepines includes alprazolam Xanax chlordiazepoxideLibrium diazepam Valium and lorazepam AtivanThese medicines take effect fairly quickly starting to workwithin an hour after they are taken Benzodiazepines areavailable only with a physicians prescription and areavailable in tablet capsule liquid or injectable forms Recommended dosage The recommended dosage depends on the type of benzodiazepine its strength and the condition for whichit is being taken Doses may be different for differentpeople Check with the physician who prescribed thedrug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for thecorrect dosage Always take benzodiazepines exactly as directed Never take larger or more frequent doses and do not takethe drug for longer than directed If the medicine does notseem to be working check with the physician who prescribed it Do not increase the dose or stop taking the medicine unless the physician says to do so Stopping the drug suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms especially if it has been taken in large doses or over a longperiod People who are taking the medicine for seizuredisorders may have seizures if they stop taking it suddenly If it is necessary to stop taking the medicine checkwith a physician for directions on how to stop The physician may recommend tapering down gradually to reducethe chance of withdrawal symptoms or other problems Precautions Seeing a physician regularly while taking benzodi azepines is important especially during the first fewmonths of treatment The physician will check to makesure the medicine is working as it should and will noteunwanted side effects People who take benzodiazepines to relieve nervous ness tension or symptoms of panic disorder shouldcheck with their physicians every two to three months tomake sure they still need to keep taking the medicine Patients who are taking benzodiazepines for sleep problems should check with their physicians if they arenot sleeping better within days Sleep problems thatlast longer than this may be a sign of another medicalproblem People who take this medicine to help them sleep may have trouble sleeping when they stop taking themedicine This effect should last only a few nights Some people especially older people feel drowsy dizzy lightheaded or less alert when using benzodiazepines The drugs may also cause clumsiness orunsteadiness When the medicine is taken at bedtimethese effects may even occur the next morning Anyonewho takes these drugs should not drive use machines ordo anything else that might be dangerous until they havefound out how the drugs affect them GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BenzodiazepinesGEM to B PM Page Benzodiazepines may also cause behavior changes in some people similar to those seen in people who actdifferently when they drink alcohol More extremechanges such as confusion agitation and hallucina tions also are possible Anyone who starts having strange or unusual thoughts or behavior while taking thismedicine should get in touch with his or her physician Because benzodiazepines work on the central ner vous system they may add to the effects of alcohol andother drugs that slow down the central nervous systemsuch as antihistamines cold medicine allergy medicine sleep aids medicine for seizures tranquilizers some pain relievers and muscle relaxants They may also add to the effects of anesthetics including those used for dental procedures These effects may last several days after treatment with benzodiazepines ends The combined effects of benzodiazepines and alcohol or other CNS depressantsdrugs that slow the central nervous system can be verydangerous leading to unconsciousness or rarely evendeath Anyone taking benzodiazepines should not drink alcohol and should check with his or her physician beforeusing any CNS depressants Taking an overdose of benzo diazepines can also cause unconsciousness and possiblydeath Anyone who shows signs of an overdose or of theeffects of combining benzodiazepines with alcohol orother drugs should get immediate emergency help Warn ing signs include slurred speech or confusion severedrowsiness staggering and profound weakness Some benzodiazepines may change the results of certain medical tests Before having medical tests anyone taking this medicine should alert the health care professional in charge Children are generally more sensitive than adults to the effects of benzodiazepines This sensitivity mayincrease the chance of side effects Older people are more sensitive than younger adults to the effects of this medicine and may be at greater riskfor side effects Older people who take these drugs tohelp them sleep may be drowsy during the day Olderpeople also increase their risk of falling and injuringthemselves when they take these drugs Special conditions People with certain medical conditions or who are taking certain other medicines can have problems if theytake benzodiazepines Before taking these drugs be sureto let the physician know about any of these conditions ALLERGIES Anyone who has had unusual reactions to benzodiazepines or other moodaltering drugs in the pastshould let his or her physician know before taking thedrugs again The physician should also be told about anyallergies to foods dyes preservatives or other substancesPREGNANCY Some benzodiazepines increase the likelihood of birth defects Using these medicines during pregnancy may also cause the baby to become dependent on them and to have withdrawal symptoms after birthWhen taken late in pregnancy or around the time of laborand delivery these drugs can cause other problems in thenewborn baby such as weakness breathing problemsslow heartbeat and body temperature problems Women who are pregnant or who may become preg nant

many systems of the body including the muscles heart nerves and digestivesystem Beriberi literally means I cant I cant in Singhalese which reflects the crippling effect it has on itsvictims It is common in parts of southeast Asia wherewhite rice is the main food In the United States beriberiis primarily seen in people with chronic alcoholism Description Beriberi puzzled medical experts for years as it rav aged people of all ages in Asia Doctors thought it wascaused by something in food Not until the early sdid scientists discover that rice bran the outer coveringthat was removed to create the polished white rice preferred by Asians actually contained something that prevented the disease Thiamine was the first vitamin identified In the s extracts of rice polishings were usedto treat the disease In adults there are different forms of beriberi classi fied according to the body systems most affected Dryberiberi involves the nervous system wet beriberi affectsthe heart and circulation Both types usually occur in thesame patient with one set of symptoms predominating A less common form of cardiovascular or wet beriberi is known as shoshin This condition involves arapid appearance of symptoms and acute heart failure It is highly fatal and is known to cause sudden death in young migrant laborers in Asia whose diet consists ofwhite rice Cerebral beriberi also known as WernickeKorsakoff syndrome usually occurs in chronic alcoholics and affectsthe central nervous system brain and spinal cord It canbe caused by a situation that aggravates a chronic thiaminedeficiency like an alcoholic binge or severe vomiting Infantile beriberi is seen in breastfed infants of thi aminedeficient mothers who live in developing nations Although severe beriberi is uncommon in the United States less severe thiamine deficiencies do occur About of all alcoholics admitted to a hospital in the UnitedStates show some evidence of thiamine deficiency Causes and symptoms Thiamine is one of the B vitamins and plays an important role in energy metabolism and tissue buildingIt combines with phosphate to form the coenzyme thi amine pyrophosphate TPP which is essential in reac tions that produce energy from glucose or that convertglucose to fat for storage in the tissues When there is notenough thiamine in the diet these basic energy functionsare disturbed leading to problems throughout the body Special situations such as an overactive metabo lism prolonged fever pregnancy and breastfeeding can increase the bodys thiamine requirements and leadto symptoms of deficiency Extended periods of diar rhea or chronic liver disease can result in the bodys inability to maintain normal levels of many nutrientsincluding thiamine Other persons at risk are patientswith kidney failure on dialysis and those with severedigestive problems who are unable to absorb nutrientsAlcoholics are susceptible because they may substitutealcohol for food and their frequent intake of alcoholdecreases the bodys ability to absorb thiamine GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BeriberiGEM to B PM Page The following systems are most affected by beriberi Gastrointestinal system When the cells of the smooth muscles in the digestive system and glands do not getenough energy from glucose they are unable to produce more glucose from the normal digestion of foodThere is a loss of appetite indigestion severe consti pation and a lack of hydrochloric acid in the stomach Nervous System Glucose is essential for the central nervous system to function normally Early deficiencysymptoms are fatigue irritability and poor memory If the deficiency continues there is damage to the peripheral nerves that causes loss of sensation and muscleweakness which is called peripheral neuropathy The legs are most affected The toes feel numb and the feethave a burning sensation the leg muscles become soreand the calf muscles cramp The individual walksunsteadily and has difficulty getting up from a squattingposition Eventually the muscles shrink atrophy andthere is a loss of reflexes in the knees and feet the feetmay hang limp footdrop Cardiovascular system There is a rapid heartbeat and sweating Eventually the heart muscle weakensBecause the smooth muscle in the blood vessels isaffected the arteries and veins relax causing swellingknown as edema in the legs Musculoskeletal system There is widespread muscle pain caused by the lack of TPP in the muscle tissue Infants who are breastfed by a thiaminedeficient mother usually develop symptoms of deficiency between thesecond and fourth month of life They are pale restlessunable to sleep prone to diarrhea and have musclewasting and edema in their arms and legs They have acharacteristic sometimes silent cry and develop heartfailure and nerve damage Diagnosis A physical examination will reveal many of the early symptoms of beriberi such as fatigue irritationnausea constipation and poor memory but the deficiency may be difficult to identify Information about theindividuals diet and general health is also needed There are many biochemical tests based on thiamine metabolism or the functions of TPP that can detect a thiamine deficiency Levels of thiamine can be measured inthe blood and urine and will be reduced if there is a deficiency The urine can be collected for hours to measure the level of thiamine excreted Another reliable testmeasures the effect of TPP on red blood cell activitysince all forms of beriberi affect the metabolism of redblood cellsAn electroencephalogram EEG which measures electrical activity in the brain may be done to rule outother causes of neurologic changes Observing improvements in the patient after giving thiamine supplementswill also confirm the diagnosis Treatment Treatment with thiamine reverses the deficiency in the body and relieves most of the symptoms Severe thiamine deficiency is treated with high doses of thiaminegiven by injection into a muscle intramuscular or in asolution that goes into a vein intravenously for severaldays Then smaller doses can be given either by injectionor in pill form until the patient recovers Usually thereare other deficiencies in the B vitamins that will alsoneed treatment The cardiovascular symptoms of wet beriberi can respond to treatment within a few hours if they are nottoo severe Heart failure may require additional treatmentwith diuretics that help eliminate excess fluid and with heartstrengthening drugs like digitalis Recovery from peripheral neuropathy and other symptoms of dry beriberi may take longer and patientsfrequently become discouraged They should stay activephysical therapy will also help in recovery Infantile beriberi is treated by giving thiamine to both the infant and the breast feeding mother until levelsare normal In WernickeKorsakoff syndrome thiamine should be given intravenously or by injection at first because theintestinal absorption of thiamine is probably impairedand the patient is very ill Most of the symptoms will berelieved by treatment though there may be residualmemory loss Excess thiamine is excreted by the body in the urine and negative reactions to too much thiamine are rareThiamine is unstable in alkali solutions so it should notbe taken with antacids or barbiturates Alternative treatment Alternative treatments for beriberi deal first with correcting the thiamine deficiency As in conventionaltreatments alternative treatments for beriberi stress a diet rich in foods that provide thiamine and other B vitamins such as brown rice whole grains raw fruits andvegetables legumes seeds nuts and yogurt Drinkingmore than one glass of liquid with a meal should beavoided since this may wash out the vitamins beforethey can be absorbed by the body Thiamine should betaken daily with the dose depending on the severity of GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BeriberiGEM to B PM Page the disease Additional supplements of B vitamins a multivitamin and mineral complex and Vitamin C arealso recommended Other alternative therapies may helprelieve the persons symptoms after the thiamine deficiency is corrected Prognosis Beriberi is fatal if not treated and the longer the defi ciency exists the sicker the person becomes Most of thesymptoms can be reversed and full recovery is possiblewhen thiamine levels are returned to normal and maintained with a balanced diet and vitamin supplements asneeded Prevention A balanced diet containing all essential nutrients will prevent a thiamine deficiency and the developmentof beriberi People who consume large quantities of junkfood like soda pretzels chips candy and high carbohydrate foods made with unenriched flours may be deficient in thiamine and other vital nutrients They mayneed to take vitamin supplements and should improvetheir diets Dietary Requirements The bodys requirements for thiamine are tied to car bohydrate metabolism and expressed in terms of totalintake of calories The current recommended dietaryallowances RDA are mg for every calorieswith a minimum daily intake of mg even for those whoeat fewer than calories in a day The RDA for children and teenagers is the same as for adults mg dailyfor males over age eleven and mg for females During pregnancy an increase to mg daily is neededBecause of increased energy needs and the secretion ofthiamine in breast milk breast feeding mothers need mg every day In infants mg is advised Food Sources The best food sources of thiamine are lean pork beef liver brewers yeast peas and beans whole orenriched grains and breads The more refined the foodas in white rice white breads and some cereals thelower the thiamine Many food products are enrichedwith thiamine along with riboflavin niacin and iron toprevent dietary

Berylliosis Definition Berylliosis is lung inflammation caused by inhaling dust or fumes that contain the metallic element berylliumFound in rocks coal soil and volcanic dust beryllium isused in the aerospace industry and in many types of manufacturing Berylliosis occurs in both acute and chronicforms In some cases appearance of the disease may bedelayed as much as years after exposure to beryllium Description In the s scientists discovered that beryllium could make fluorescent light bulbs last longer During thefollowing decade the hard grayish metal was identifiedas the cause of a potentially debilitating sometimesdeadly disease characterized by shortness of breath and inflammation swelling and scarring of the lungs The manufacture of fluorescent light bulbs is no longer a source of beryllium exposure but serious healthhazards are associated with any work environment orprocess in which beryllium fumes or particles becomeairborne Working with pure beryllium beryllium compounds eg beryllium oxide or beryllium alloys causesoccupational exposure So do jobs involving electronics fiber optics manufacturing ceramics bicycle frames golf clubs mirrors and microwave ovens mining nuclear weapons and reactors reclaiming scrap metal space and atomic engineering dental and laboratory technology Beryllium dust and fumes are classified as toxic air pollutants by the Environmental Protection AgencyEPA It is estimated that of workers exposed tothese contaminants eventually develop berylliosis Causes and symptoms Coughing shortness of breath and weight loss that begin abruptly can be a symptom of acute berylliosis Thiscondition is caused by beryllium air pollution that inflamesthe lungs making them rigid it can affect the eyes and skinas well People who have acute berylliosis are usually veryill Most recover but some die of the disease Chronic berylliosis is an allergic reaction to long term exposure to even low levels of beryllium dust orfumes A systemic disease that causes formation ofabnormal lung tissue and enlargement of the lymphnodes chronic berylliosis also may affect other parts ofthe body The symptoms of chronic berylliosis are largely the same as those seen in acute berylliosis but theydevelop more slowly Diagnosis Berylliosis is initially suspected if a patient with symp toms of the disease has a history of beryllium exposure Achest x ray shows characteristic changes in the lungs However since these changes can resemble those causedby other lung diseases further testing may be necessary The beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test BeLPT a blood test that can detect beryllium sensitivity ie anallergic reaction to beryllium is used to screen individualsat risk of developing berylliosis When screening resultsreveal a high level of sensitivity BeLPT is performed oncells washed from the lungs This test is now consideredthe most definitive diagnostic test for berylliosis Treatment Individuals with beryllium sensitivity or earlystage berylliosis should be transferred from tasks that involveberyllium exposure and regularly examined to determinewhether the disease has progressed Acute berylliosis is a serious disease that occasion ally may be fatal Ventilators can help patients with acuteberylliosis breathe Prompt corticosteroid therapy isrequired to lessen lung inflammation Chronic beryllium disease is incurable Corticos teroid therapy is often prescribed but it is not certain thatsteroids can alter the progression of the disease and theyhave no effect on scarring of lung tissue Cleansing thelungs of beryllium is a slow process so longterm therapy may be required Chelation therapy is currently under investigation as a treatment for the disease Prognosis Most patients with acute berylliosis recover fully days after treatment begins and the disease usuallycauses no after effects Patients whose lungs are severely damaged by chronic berylliosis may experience fatal heart failure because of the strain placed on the heart Prevention Eliminating exposure to beryllium is the surest way to prevent berylliosis Screening workers who areexposed to beryllium fumes or dust or who develop anallergic

theglomeruli cant filter it out of the blood so levelsincrease in the blood and decrease in the urine In tubularkidney disease the tubules cant reabsorb it back into theblood so urine levels rise and blood levels fall After akidney transplant increased blood levels may be an earlysign of rejection Increased urinary levels are found in people with kidney damage caused by high exposure to the heavymetals cadmium and mercury Periodic testing of workers exposed to these metals helps to detect beginning kidney damage Beta microglobulin levels also rise during infec tion with some viruses including cytomegalovirus andhuman immunodeficiency virus HIV Studies show that as HIV disease advances beta microglobulin lev els rise Description Testing methods vary but most involve adding the

Definition Bile duct cancer or cholangiocarcinoma is a malig nant tumor of the bile ducts within the liver intrahepaticor leading from the liver to the small intestine extrahepatic It is a rare tumor with poor outcome for most patients Description Bile is a substance manufactured by the liver that aids in the digestion of food Bile ducts are channels thatcarry the bile from the liver to the small intestine Likethe tributaries of a river the small bile ducts in the liverconverge into two large bile ducts called the left and righthepatic ducts These exit the liver and join to form thecommon hepatic duct The gallbladder which concentrates and stores the bile empties into the commonhepatic duct to form the common bile duct Finally thislarge duct connects to the small intestine where the bilecan help digest food Collectively this network of bileducts is called the biliary tract Bile duct cancer originates from the cells that line the inner surface of the bile ducts A tumor may ariseanywhere along the biliary tract either within or outsideof the liver Bile duct tumors are typically slowgrowingtumors that spread by local invasion of neighboringstructures and by way of lymphatic channels Bile duct cancer is an uncommon malignancy In the United States approximately one case arises per people per year but it is more common in SoutheastAsia It occurs in men only slightly more often than inwomen and it is most commonly diagnosed in people intheir s and s Causes and symptoms A number of risk factors are associated with the development of bile duct cancer Primary sclerosing cholangitis This disease is charac terized by extensive scarring of the biliary tract sometimes associated with inflammatory bowel disease Choledochal cysts These are abnormal dilatations of the biliary tract that usually form during fetal development There is evidence that these cysts may rarelyarise during adulthood Hepatolithiasis This is the condition of stone formation within the liver not including gallbladder stones Liver flukes Parasitic infection with certain worms is thought to be at least partially responsible for the higherprevalence of bile duct cancer in

excessamounts This can be detected in a blood test but it canalso manifest as yellowish discoloring of the skin andeyes The bilirubin in the bloodstream also makes theurine appear dark Additionally the patient may experience generalized itching due to the deposition of bile components in the skin Normally a portion of the bile isexcreted in stool bile actually gives stool its browncolor But when

Radiographic imaging technique uti lizing high frequency sound wavesswell enormously yet without causing pain the physician may be able to feel the gallbladder during a physical examination Sometimes the biliary tract can become infected but this is normally a rare consequence of invasive tests Infection causes fever chills and pain in the right upper portion of the abdomen Diagnosis Certain laboratory tests of the blood may aid in the diagnosis The most important one is the test for elevatedbilirubin levels in the bloodstream Levels of alkalinephosphatase and CA may also be elevated When symptoms physical signs and blood tests poinmt toward an abnormality of the biliary tract thenthe next step involves radiographic tests Ultrasound andcomputed tomography CT scan are noninvasive andrapid These tests can often detect the actual tumor aswell as dilatation of the obstructed biliary tract If thesetests indicate the presence of a tumor then cholangiography is required This procedure involves injecting dyeinto the biliary tract to obtain anatomic images of the bileducts and the tumor The specialist that performs this testcan also insert small tubes or stents into a partiallyobstructed portion of the bile duct to prevent furtherobstruction by growth of the tumor This is vitally important since it may be the only intervention that is possiblein certain patients Cholangiography is an invasive testthat carries a small risk of infection of the biliary tractThe objective of these radiological tests is to determinethe size and location of the tumor as well as the extent ofspread to nearby structures The treatment of bile duct tumors is usually not affected by the specific type of cancer cells that comprisethe tumor For this reason some physicians forego biopsy of the tumor Treatment The treatment is with surgical resection removal of the tumor and all involved structures Unfortunatelysometimes the cancer has already spread too far when thediagnosis is made Thus in the treatment of bile duct cancer the first question to answer is if the tumor may besafely resected by surgery with reasonable benefit to thepatient If the cancer involves certain blood vessels or hasspread widely throughout the liver then resection may notbe possible Sometimes further invasive testing is required Angiography can determine if the blood vessels are involved Laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to directly assess the tumor and nearby lymphnodes without making a large incision in the abdomen Onlyabout of bile duct cancers are ultimately resectable GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bile duct cancerGEM to B PM Page If the tumor is resectable and the patient is healthy enough to tolerate the operation then the specific type ofsurgery performed depends on the location of the tumorFor tumors within the liver or high up in the biliary tractresection of part of the liver may be required Tumors inthe middle portion of the biliary tract can be removedalone Tumors of the lower end of the biliary tract mayrequire extensive resection of part of the pancreas smallintestine and stomach to ensure complete resection Unfortunately sometimes the cancer appears resectable by all the radiological and invasive tests but isfound to be unresectable during surgery In this scenario abypass operation can relieve the biliary tract obstructionbut does not remove the tumor itself This does not producea cure but it can offer a better quality of life for the patient Chemotherapy and radiation therapy have not been

commonly less than oneyear If the tumor is resected the survival rate improveswith of these patients surviving past five years Clinical trials Studies of new treatments in patients are known as clinical trials These trials seek to compare the standardmethod of care with a new method or the trials may be trying to establish whether one treatment is more beneficialfor certain patients than others Sometimes a new treatment that is not being offered on a wide scale may be available to patients participating in clinical trials but participating in the trials may involve some risk To learn

Description Biliary atresia is the most common lethal liver disease in children occurring once every livebirths Half of all liver transplants are done for this reason The normal anatomy of the bile system begins with in the liver where thousands of tiny bile ducts collectbile from liver cells These ducts merge into larger andlarger channels like streams flowing into rivers untilthey all pour into a single duct that empties into the duodenum first part of the small intestine Between theliver and the duodenum this duct has a side channel connected to the gall bladder The gall bladder stores bileand concentrates it removing much of its water contentThen when a meal hits the stomach the gall bladdercontracts and empties its contents Bile is a mixture of waste chemicals that the liver removes from the circulation and excretes through thebiliary system into the intestine On its way out bileassists in the digestion of certain nutrients If bile cannotget out because the channels are absent or blocked itbacks up into the liver and eventually into the rest of thebody The major pigment in bile is a chemical calledbilirubin which is yellow Bilirubin is a breakdown product of hemoglobin the red chemical in blood that carriesoxygen If the body accumulates an excess of bilirubin GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Biliary atresiaGEM to B PM Page KEY TERMS Duodenum The first part of the small intestine beginning at the outlet of the stomach Hemoglobin The red ironcontaining chemical in the blood that carries oxygen to the tissues Jaundice The yellow color taken on by a patient whose liver is unable to excrete bilirubin A normalcondition in the first week of life due to the infantsdelayed ability to process certain waste products Kernicterus A potentially lethal disease of new borns caused by excessive accumulation of thebile pigment bilirubin it turns yellow jaundiced Bile also turns the stool brown Without it stools are the color of clay Causes and symptoms It is possible that a viral infection is responsible for this disease but evidence is not yet convincing Thecause remains unknown The affected infant will appear normal at birth and during the newborn period After two weeks the normaljaundice of the newborn will not disappear and the stools will probably be claycolored At this point thecondition will come to the attention of a physician If notthe childs abdomen will begin to swell and the infantwill get progressively more ill Nearly all untreated children will die of liver failure within two years Diagnosis The persistence of jaundice beyond the second week in a newborn with claycolored stools is a sure sign ofobstruction to the flow of bile An immediate evaluationthat includes blood tests and imaging of the biliary system will confirm the diagnosis Treatment Surgery is the only treatment Somehow the surgeon must create an adequate pathway for bile to escape theliver into the intestine The altered anatomy of the biliarysystem is different in every case calling upon the surgeons skill and experience to select and execute the most effective among several options If the obstruction is onlybetween the gall bladder and the intestine it is possible toattach a piece of intestine directly to the gall bladder Morelikely the upper biliary system will also be inadequateand the surgeon will attach a piece of intestine directly tothe liverthe Kasai procedure In its wisdom the bodywill discover that the tiny bile ducts in that part of the liverare discharging their bile directly into the intestine Bilewill begin to flow in that direction and the channels willgradually enlarge Survival rates for the Kasai procedureare commonly at five years and at years Persistent disease in the liver gradually destroys the organ Liver transplantation must be anticipated in all but the few patients who continue to do well after a Kasaiprocedure Accumulating experience and newer techniques of liver transplantation are producing very gratifying early results Prognosis Before liver transplants became available even prompt and effective surgery did not cure the wholeproblem Biliary drainage can usually be established butthe patients still have a defective biliary system thatdevelops progressive disease and commonly leads to anearly death Transplantation now achieves up to oneyear survival rates and promises to prevent thechronic

Bingeeating disorder Definition Binge eating disorder BED is characterized by a loss of control over eating behaviors The binge eaterconsumes unnaturally large amounts of food in a shorttime period but unlike a bulimic does not regularlyengage in any inappropriate weightreducing behaviorsfor example excessive exercise vomiting taking laxa tives following the binge episodes Description BED typically strikes individuals sometime between adolescence and the early twenties Because of the natureof the disorder most BED patients are overweight orobese Studies of weight loss programs have shown thatan average of of individuals enrolling in these programs report binge eating behavior Causes and symptoms Binge eating episodes may act as a psychological release for excessive emotional stress Other circum stances that may predispose an individual to BED includeheredity and affective disorders such as major depressionBED patients are also more likely to have a comorbid orcoexisting diagnosis of impulsive behaviors for example compulsive buying posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD panic disorder or personality disorders Individuals who develop BED often come from fam ilies who put an unnatural emphasis on the importance offood for example as a source of comfort in times ofemotional distress As children BED patients may havebeen taught to clean their plate regardless of theirappetite or that finishing a meal made them a goodgirl or boy Cultural attitudes towards beauty and thinness may also be a factor in the BED equation During binge episodes BED patients experience a definite sense of lost control over their eating They eatquickly and to the point of discomfort even if they arenthungry They typically binge alone two or more times aweek and often feel depressed and guilty once theepisode has concluded Diagnosis Binge eating disorder is usually diagnosed and treated by a psychiatrist andor a psychologist In addition to aninterview with the patient personality and behavioralinventories such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Person ality Inventory MMPI may be administered as part of the assessment process One of several clinical inventoriesor scales may also be used to assess depressive symptomsincluding the Hamilton Depression Scale HAMD orBeck Depression Inventory BDI These tests may beadministered in an outpatient or hospital setting Treatment Many BED individuals binge after long intervals of excessive dietary restraint therapy helps normalize thispattern The initial goal of BED treatment is to teach thepatient to gain control over his eating behavior by focusing on eating regular meals and avoiding snacking Cog nitivebehavioral therapy group therapy or interper sonal psychotherapy may be employed to uncover theemotional motives distorted thinking and behavioralpatterns behind the binge eating Because the prevalence of depression in BED patients is high psychopharmacological treatment withantidepressants may also be prescribed Once the bingeeating behavior is curbed and depressive symptoms arecontrolled the physical symptoms of BED can beaddressed The overweight BED patient may be placedon a moderate exercise program and a nutritionist may beconsulted to educate the patient on healthy food choicesand strategies for weight loss Prognosis The poor dietary habits and obesity that are sympto matic of BED can lead to serious

is a patientguided treatment that teaches an individual to control muscle tension pain body temperature brain waves and other bodily functions and processesthrough relaxation visualization and other cognitive control techniques The name biofeedback refers to the biological signals that are fed back or returned to the patientin order for the patient to develop techniques of manipulating them Purpose Biofeedback has been used to successfully treat a number of disorders and their symptoms including tem poromandibular joint disorder TMJ chronic pain irritable bowel syndrome IBS Raynauds syndrome epilepsy attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorderADHD migraine headaches anxiety depression trau matic brain injury and sleep disorders Illnesses that may be triggered at least in part by stress are also targeted by biofeedback therapy Certain types of headaches high blood pressure bruxism teeth grinding posttraumatic stress disorder eating disor ders substance abuse and some anxiety disorders may be treated successfully by teaching patients the ability torelax and release both muscle and mental tensionBiofeedback is often just one part of a comprehensivetreatment program for some of these disorders NASA has used biofeedback techniques to treat astronauts who suffer from severe space sickness duringwhich the autonomic nervous system is disrupted Scientists at the University of Tennessee have adapted thesetechniques to treat individuals suffering from severenausea and vomiting that is also rooted in autonomic nervous system dysfunction Recent research also indicates that biofeedback may be a useful tool in helping patients with urinary inconti nence regain bladder control Individuals learning pelvic floor muscle strengthening exercises can gain better control over these muscles by using biofeedback Sensors areplaced on the muscles to train the patient where they areand when proper contractions are taking place Description Origins In Neal Miller an experimental psychologist suggested that autonomic nervous system responses for GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BiofeedbackGEM to B PM Page instance heart rate blood pressure gastrointestinal activity regional blood flow could be under voluntarycontrol As a result of his experiments he showed thatsuch autonomic processes were controllable This workled to the creation of biofeedback therapy Willers workwas expanded by other researchers Thereafter researchperformed in the s by UCLA researcher Dr BarrySterman established that both cats and monkeys could betrained to control their brain wave patterns Sterman thenused his research techniques on human patients withepilepsy where he was able to reduce seizures by with the use of biofeedback techniques Throughout thes other researchers published reports of their use ofbiofeedback in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias headaches Raynauds syndrome and excess stomachacid and as a tool for teaching deep relaxation Since theearly work of Miller and Sterman biofeedback hasdeveloped into a frontline behavioral treatment for aneven wider range of disorders and symptoms During biofeedback special sensors are placed on the body These sensors measure the bodily function thatis causing the patient problem symptoms such as heartrate blood pressure muscle tension EMG or electromyographic feedback brain waves EEC or electroencophalographic feedback respiration and bodytemperature thermal feedback and translates the information into a visual andor audible readout such as apaper tracing a light display or a series of beeps While the patient views the instantaneous feedback from the biofeedback monitors he or she begins to recognize what thoughts fears and mental images influence hisor her physical reactions By monitoring this relationshipbetween mind and body the patient can then use thesesame thoughts and mental images as subtle cues as theseact as reminders to become deeply relaxed instead of anxious These reminders also work to manipulate heart beatbrain wave patterns body temperature and other bodilyfunctions This is achieved through relaxation exercisesmental imagery and other cognitive therapy techniques As the biofeedback response takes place patients can actually see or hear the results of their efforts instantly through the sensor readout on the biofeedback equipment Once these techniques are learned and the patientis able to recognize the state of relaxation or visualization necessary to alleviate symptoms the biofeedbackequipment itself is no longer needed The patient thenhas a powerful portable and selfadministered treatmenttool to deal with problem symptoms Biofeedback that specializes in reading and altering brain waves is sometimes called neurofeedback The brain produces four distinct types of brain wavesdeltatheta alpha and betathat all operate at a different frequency Delta the slowest frequency wave is the brain wave pattern associated with sleep Beta waves whichoccur in a normal waking state can range from Hz Problems begin to develop when beta wave averagesfall in the low end underarousal or the high end overarousal of that spectrum Underarousal might be presentin conditions such as depression or attentiondeficit disorder and overarousal may be indicative of an anxietydisorder obsessive compulsive disorder or excessivestress Beta wave neurofeedback focuses on normalizingthat beta wave pattern to an optimum value of around Hz A second type of neurofeedback alphatheta focuses on developing the more relaxing alpha Hz andtheta waves Hz that are usually associated withdeep meditative states and has been used with somesuccess in substance abuse treatment Through brain wave manipulation neurofeedback can be useful in treating a variety of disorders that aresuspected or proven to impact brain wave patterns suchas epilepsy attentiondeficit disorder migraineheadaches anxiety depression traumatic brain injuryand sleep disorders The equipment used for neurofeedback usually uses a monitor as an output device Themonitor displays specific patterns that the patientattempts to change by producing the appropriate type ofbrain wave Or the monitor may reward the patient forproducing the appropriate brain wave by producing apositive reinforcer or reward For example children maybe rewarded with a series of successful moves in a displayed video game GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Biofeedback A patient undergoing biofeedback therapy Photo Researchers Inc Reproduced by permissionGEM to B PM Page Depending on the type of biofeedback individuals may need up to sessions with a trained professional tolearn the techniques required to control their symptomson a longterm basis Therapists usually recommend thattheir patients practice both biofeedback and relaxationtechniques on their own at home Preparations Before initiating biofeedback treatment the thera pist and patient will have an initial consultation to recordthe patients medical history and treatment backgroundand discuss goals for therapy Before a neurofeedback session an EEG is taken from the patient to determine his or her baseline brainwave pattern Biofeedback typically is performed in a quiet and relaxed atmosphere with comfortable seating for thepatient Depending on the type and goals of biofeedbackbeing performed one or more sensors will be attached tothe patients body with conductive gel andor adhesivesThese may include Electromyographic EMG sensors EMG sen sors measure electrical activity in the muscles specifically muscle tension In treating TMJ or bruxism

placed on the fingers that monitor perspirationor sweat gland activity These may also be called skinconductance level SCL Temperature sensors Temperature or thermal sensors measure body temperature and changes in blood flow Electroencephalography EEG sensors These elec trodes are applied to the scalp to measure the electricalactivity of the brain or brain waves Heart rate sensors A pulse monitor placed on the finger tip can monitor pulse rate Respiratory sensors Respiratory sensors monitor oxy gen intake and carbon dioxide output Precautions Individuals who use a pacemaker or other implantable electrical devices should inform theirbiofeedback therapist before starting treatments as certain types of biofeedback sensors have the potential tointerfere with these devices Biofeedback may not be suitable for some patients Patients must be willing to take a very active role in thetreatment process And because biofeedback focuses strictly on behavioral change those patients who wish togain insight into their symptoms by examining their pastmight be better served by psychodynamic therapy Biofeedback may also be inappropriate for cogni tively impaired individuals such as those patients withorganic brain disease or a traumatic brain injury depending on their levels of functioning Patients with specific pain symptoms of unknown origin should undergo a thorough medical examinationbefore starting biofeedback treatments to rule out anyserious underlying disease Once a diagnosis has beenmade biofeedback can be used concurrently with conventional treatment Biofeedback may only be one component of a com prehensive treatment plan For illnesses and symptomsthat are manifested from an organic disease process suchas cancer or diabetes biofeedback should be an adjunct to complementary to and not a replacement for conventional medical treatment Side effects There are no known side effects to properly adminis tered biofeedback or neurofeedback sessions Research and general acceptance Preliminary research published in late indicat ed that neurofeedback may be a promising new tool inthe treatment of schizophrenia Researchers reported that schizophrenic patients had used neurofeedback tosimulate brain wave patterns that antipsychotic medications produce in the brain Further research is needed todetermine what impact this may have on treatment forschizophrenia The use of biofeedback techniques to treat an array of disorders has been extensively described in the medical literature Controlled studies for some applications are limited such as for the treatment of menopausal symptoms andpremenstrual disorder PMS There is also some debateover the effectiveness of biofeedback in ADHD treatmentand the lack of controlled studies on that application Whilemany therapists counselors and mental health professionals have reported great success with treating their ADHDpatients with neurofeedback techniques some criticsattribute this positive therapeutic impact to a placebo effect There may also be some debate among mental health professionals as to whether biofeedback should beconsidered a first line treatment for some mental illnesses and to what degree

manicdepressive disorder is a mood dis order that causes radical emotional changes and moodswings from manic highs to depressive lows The majority of bipolar individuals experience alternating episodesof mania and depression Description In the United States alone bipolar disorder afflicts almost two million people at an annual cost of over billion according to a report by the National Institutes ofMental Health The average age of onset of bipolar disorder is from adolescence through the early twenties However because of the complexity of the disorder a correctdiagnosis can be delayed for several years or more In asurvey of bipolar patients conducted by the NationalDepressive and Manic Depressive AssociationMDMDA onehalf of respondents reported visitingthree or more professionals before receiving a correctdiagnosis and over onethird reported a wait of ten yearsor more before they were correctly diagnosed The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition DSMIV the diagnostic stan dard for mental health professionals in the United Statesdefines four separate categories of bipolar disorder bipolar I bipolar II cyclothymia and bipolar nototherwisespecified NOS GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bipolar disorderGEM to B PM Page Bipolar I disorder is characterized by manic episodes the high of the manicdepressive cycle Abipolar patient experiencing mania often has feelings ofselfimportance elation talkativeness increased sociability and a desire to embark on goaloriented activitiescoupled with the characteristics of irritability impatience impulsiveness hyperactivity and a decreasedneed for sleep Usually this manic period is followed bya period of depression although a few bipolar I individuals may not experience a major depressive episodeMixed states where both manic or hypomanic symptomsand depressive symptoms occur at the same time alsooccur frequently with bipolar I patients for exampledepression with the racing thoughts of mania Also dysphoric mania is common mania characterized by angerand irritability Bipolar II disorder is characterized by major depres sive episodes alternating with episodes of hypomania amilder form of mania Bipolar depression may be difficult to distinguish from a unipolar major depressiveepisode Patients with bipolar depression tend to haveextremely low energy retarded mental and physicalprocesses and more profound fatigue for example hypersomnia a sleep disorder marked by a need forexcessive sleep or sleepiness when awake than unipolardepressives Cyclothymia refers to the cycling of hypomanic episodes with depression that does not reach major depressive proportions A third of patients with cyclothymia willdevelop bipolar I or II disorder later in life A phenomenon known as rapid cycling occurs in up to of bipolar I and II patients In rapid cyclingmanic and depressive episodes must alternate frequentlyat least times in months to meet the diagnostic definition In some cases of ultrarapid cycling the patientmay bounce between manic and depressive states severaltimes within a hour period This condition is veryhard to distinguish from mixed states Bipolar NOS is a category for bipolar states that do not clearly fit into the bipolar I II or cyclothymia diagnoses Causes and symptoms The source of bipolar disorder has not been clearly defined Because twothirds of bipolar patients have afamily history of affective or emotional disordersresearchers have searched for a genetic link to the disorder Several studies have uncovered a number of possiblegenetic connections to the predisposition for bipolar disorder Another possible biological cause under investigation is the presence of an excessive calcium buildup inthe cells of bipolar patients Also dopamine and other neurochemical transmitters appear to be implicated inbipolar disorder and these are under intense investigation Over half of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder have a history of substance abuse There is a high rate ofassociation between cocaine abuse and bipolar disorder Some studies have shown up to of abusers meetingthe criteria for bipolar disorder The emotional and physical highs and lows of cocaine use correspond to themanic depression of the bipolar patient making the disorder difficult to diagnosis For some bipolar patients manic and depressive episodes coincide with seasonal changes Depressiveepisodes are typical during winter and fall and manicepisodes are more probable in the spring and summermonths Symptoms of bipolar depressive episodes include low energy levels feelings of despair difficulty concentrating extreme fatigue and psychomotor retardationslowed mental and physical capabilities Manicepisodes are characterized by feelings of euphoria lackof inhibitions racing thoughts diminished need forsleep talkativeness risk taking and irritability Inextreme cases mania can induce hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms such as grandiose illusions Diagnosis Bipolar disorder is usually diagnosed and treated by a psychiatrist andor a psychologist with medical assistance In addition to an interview several clinical inventories or scales may be used to assess the patients mentalstatus and determine the presence of bipolar symptomsThese include the Millon Clinical Multiaxial InventoryIII MCMIIII Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory II MMPI the Internal State Scale ISS the SelfReport Manic Inventory SRMI and the YoungMania Rating Scale YMRS The tests are verbal andorwritten and are administered in both hospital and outpatient settings Psychologists and psychiatrists typically use the cri teria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition DSMIV as a guide line for diagnosis of bipolar disorder and other mentalillnesses DSMIV describes a manic episode as an abnormally elevated or irritable mood lasting a period ofat least one week that is distinguished by at least three ofthe mania symptoms inflated selfesteem decreasedneed for sleep talkativeness racing thoughts distractibility increase in goaldirected activity or excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have ahigh potential for painful consequences If the mood of GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bipolar disorderGEM to B PM Page the patient is irritable and not elevated four of the symp toms are required Although many clinicians find the criteria too rigid a hypomanic diagnosis requires a duration of at least fourdays with at least three of the symptoms indicated formanic episodes four if mood is irritable and not elevated DSMIV notes that unlike manic episodes hypoman ic episodes do not cause a marked impairment in socialor occupational functioning do not require hospitalization and do not have psychotic features In additionbecause hypomanic episodes are characterized by highenergy and goal directed activities and often result in apositive outcome or are perceived in a positive mannerby the patient bipolar II disorder can go undiagnosed Bipolar symptoms often present differently in chil dren and adolescents Manic episodes in these age groupsare typically characterized by more psychotic featuresthan in adults which may lead to a misdiagnosis of schiz ophrenia Children and adolescents also tend toward irri tability and aggressiveness instead of elation Furthersymptoms tend to be chronic or ongoing rather thanacute or episodic Bipolar children are easily distractedimpulsive and hyperactive which can lead to a misdiagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD Furthermore their aggression often leads to violencewhich may be misdiagnosed as a conduct disorder Substance abuse thyroid disease and use of pre scription or overthecounter medication can mask ormimic the presence of bipolar disorder In cases of substance abuse the patient must ordinarily undergo a period of detoxification and abstinence before a mood disor der is diagnosed and treatment begins Treatment Treatment of bipolar disorder is usually by means of medication A combination of mood stabilizing agentswith antidepressants antipsychotics and anticonvulsantsis used to regulate manic and depressive episodes Mood stabilizing agents such as lithium carba mazepine and valproate are prescribed to regulate themanic highs and lows of bipolar disorder Lithium CibalithS Eskalith Lithane Lithobid Lithonate Lithotabs is one of the oldest and most frequently prescribed drugs available for the treatment ofbipolar mania and depression Because the drug takesfour to ten days to reach a therapeutic level in the bloodstream it is sometimes prescribed in conjunction withneuroleptics andor benzodiazepines to provide more immediate relief of a manic episode Lithium has alsobeen shown to be effective in regulating bipolar depression but is not recommended for mixed mania Lithiummay not be an effective longterm treatment option for rapid cyclers who typically develop a tolerance for it ormay not respond to it Possible side effects of the druginclude weight gain thirst nausea and hand tremors Prolonged lithium use may also cause hyperthyroidism a disease of the thryoid that is marked by heart palpita tions nervousness the presence of goiter sweating and a wide array of other symptoms Carbamazepine Tegretol Atretol is an anticonvulsant drug usually prescribed in conjunction with other moodstabilizing agents The drug is often used to treat bipolar patients who have not responded well to lithiumtherapy Blurred vision and abnormal eye movementare two possible side effects of carbamazepine therapyAs of early carbamazepine did not have an FDAcleared indication for mania Valproate divalproex sodium or Depakote

with carbamazepine andor lithium Stomach cramps indigestion diarrhea hair loss appetite loss nausea and unusual weight loss or gain aresome of the common side effects of valproate Note valproate is also approved for the treatment of mania Because antidepressants may stimulate manic episodes in some bipolar patients their use is typicallyshortterm Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors SSRIs or less often monoamine oxidase inhibitors MAO inhibitors are prescribed for episodes of bipolardepression Tricyclic antidepressants used to treat unipolar depression may trigger rapid cycling in bipolarpatients and are therefore not a preferred treatmentoption for bipolar depression SSRIs such as fluoxetine Prozac sertraline Zoloft and paroxetine Paxil regulate depression by regulatinglevels

disorderGEM to B PM Page ECT or electroconvulsive therapy has a high success rate for treating both unipolar and bipolar depressionand mania However because of the convenience ofdrug treatment and the stigma sometimes attached toECT therapy ECT is usually employed after all pharmaceutical treatment options have been explored ECTis given under anesthesia and patients are given a muscle relaxant medication to prevent convulsions Thetreatment consists of a series of electrical pulses thatmove into the brain through electrodes on the patientshead Although the exact mechanisms behind the success of ECT therapy are not known it is believed thatthis electrical current alters the electrochemicalprocesses of the brain consequently relieving depression Headaches muscle soreness nausea and confusion are possible side effects immediately following anECT procedure Temporary memory loss has also beenreported in ECT patients In bipolar patients ECT isoften used in conjunction with drug therapy Adjunct treatments are used in conjunction with a longterm pharmaceutical treatment plan Longacting benzodiazepines such as clonazepam Klon apin and alprazolam Xanax are used for rapid treatment of manic symptoms to calm and sedate patients untilmania or hypomania have waned and mood stabilizingagents can take effect Sedation is a common effect and clumsiness lightheadedness and slurred speech are otherpossible side effects of benzodiazepines Neuroleptics such as chlorpromazine Thorazine and haloperidol Haldol are also used to control maniawhile a mood stabilizer such as lithium or valproatetakes effect Because neuroleptic side effects can besevere difficulty in speaking or swallowing paralysis of the eyes loss of balance control muscle spasmssevere restlessness stiffness of arms and legs tremorsin fingers and hands twisting movements of body andweakness of arms and legs benzodiazepines are generally preferred over neuroleptics Psychotherapy and counseling Because bipolar disorder is thought to be biological in nature therapy is recommended as a companion to but not a substitute for pharmaceutical treatment of the disease Psychotherapy suchas cognitivebehavioral therapy can be a useful tool in helping patients and their families adjust to the disorderin encouraging compliance to a medication regimen andin reducing the risk of suicide Also

are pre sent at birth they are also called congenital abnormalities More than have been identified Description Birth defects are found in of all newborn infants This rate doubles in the first year and reaches by age five as more defects become evident and canbe diagnosed Almost of deaths in newborns arecaused by birth defects Abnormalities can occur in any major organ or part of the body Major defects are structural abnormalitiesthat affect the way a person looks and require medicalandor surgical treatment Minor defects are abnormalities that do not cause serious health or social problemsWhen multiple birth defects occur together and have asimilar cause they are called syndromes If two or moredefects tend to appear together but do not share the samecause they are called associations Causes and symptoms The specific cause of many congenital abnormalities is unknown but several factors associated with pregnan cyand delivery can increase the risk of birth defects Teratogens Any substance that can cause abnormal develop ment of the egg in the mothers womb is called a teratogen In the first two months after conception the developing organism is called an embryo developmentalstages from two months to birth are called fetal Growthis rapid and each body organ has a critical period inwhich it is especially sensitive to outside influencesAbout of all congenital defects are caused by exposure to teratogens DRUGS Only a few drugs are known to cause birth defects but all have the potential to cause harm Thalidomide is known to cause defects of the arms and legs several other types also cause problems Alcohol Drinking large amounts of alcohol while preg nant causes a cluster of defects called fetal alcohol syndrome which include mental retardation heart problems and growth deficiency Antibiotics Certain antibiotics are known tetratogens Tetracycline affects bone growth and discolors theteeth Drugs used to treat tuberculosis can lead to hear ing problems and damage to a nerve in the head cranial Sulfa drugs are associated with abnormally highlevels of bilirubin in the newborn which can causedeath Anticonvulsants Drugs given to prevent seizures can cause serious problems in the developing fetus including mental retardation and slow growth Antipsychotic and antianxiety agents Several drugs given for anxiety and mental illness are known to cause specific defects Antineoplastic agents Drugs given to treat cancer can cause major congenital malformations especially centralnervous system defects They may also be harmful to thehealth care worker who is giving them while pregnant Hormones Male hormones may cause masculinization of a female fetus A synthetic estrogen DES given inthe s and s causes an increased risk of cancerin the adult female children of the mothers whoreceived the drug Recreational drugs Drugs such as LSD have been asso ciated with arm and leg abnormalities and central nervous system problems in infants Crack cocaine has also been associated with birth defects Since drugabusers tend to use many drugs and have poor nutri tion and prenatal care it is hard to determine the effects of individual drugs CHEMICALS Environmental chemicals such as fungicides food additives and pollutants are suspectedof causing birth defects though this is difficult to prove RADIATION Exposure of the mother to high levels of radiation can cause small skull size microcephaly blindness spina bifida and cleft palate How severe the defect is depends on the duration and timing of the exposure GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Birth defectsGEM to B PM Page INFECTIONS Three viruses are known to harm a developing baby rubella cytomegalovirus CMV and herpes simplex Toxoplasma gondii a parasite that can be

invisible unit containing informa tion DNA that guides how the body forms and functions Each individual inherits tens of thousands of genesfrom each parent arranged on chromosomes Genescontrol all aspects of the body how it works and all itsunique characteristics including eye color and body sizeGenes are influenced by chemicals and radiation butsometimes changes in the genes are unexplained accidents Each child gets half of its genes from each parentIn each pair of genes one will take precedence dominant over the other recessive in determining each traitor characteristic Birth defects caused by dominant inheritance include a form of dwarfism called achondropla sia high cholesterol Huntingtons disease a progressive nervous system disorder Marfan syndrome which affects connective tissue some forms of glaucoma and polydactyly extra fingers or toes If both parents carry the same recessive gene they have a oneinfour chance that the child will inherit thedisease Recessive diseases are severe and may lead to anearly death They include sickle cell anemia a blood disorder that affects blacks and TaySachs disease which causes mental retardation in people of eastern EuropeanJewish heritage Two recessive disorders that affect mostlywhites are cystic fibrosis a lung and digestive disorder and phenylketonuria PKU a metabolic disorder If only one parent passes along the genes for the disorder the normal gene received from the other parent will prevent thedisease but the child will be a carrier Having the gene isnot harmful to the carrier but there is the chance ofthe genetic

Illustrators GroupGEM to B PM Page defects can also take place when the egg or sperm are forming if the mother or father passes along some faultygene material This is more common in older mothersThe most common defect of this kind is Down syn drome a pattern of mental retardation and physical abnormalities often including heart defects caused byinheriting three copies of a chromosome rather than thenormal pair A less understood cause of birth defects results from the interaction of genes from one or both parents plusenvironmental influences These defects are thought toinclude Cleft lip and palate which are malformations of the mouth Clubfoot ankle or foot deformities Spina bifida an open spine caused when the tube that forms the brain and spinal chord does not close properly Water on the brain hydrocephalus which causes brain damage Diabetes mellitus an abnormality in sugar metabolism that appears later in life Heart defects Some forms of cancer A serious illness in the mother such as an underac tive thyroid or diabetes mellitus in which her body cannot process sugar can also cause birth defects in the child An abnormal amount of amniotic fluid may indicate orcause birth defects Amniotic fluid is the liquid that surrounds and protects the unborn child in the uterus Too little of this fluid can interfere with lung or limb development Too much amniotic fluid can accumulate if thefetus has a disorder that interferes with swallowing Diagnosis If there is a family history of birth defects or if the mother is over years old then screening tests can bedone during pregnancy to gain information about thehealth of the baby Alphafetoprotein test This is a simple blood test that measure the level of a substance called alphafetoprotein that is associated with some major birth defects Anabnormally high or low level may indicate the need forfurther testing Ultrasound The use of sound waves to examine the shape function and age of the fetus is a common procedure It can also detect many malformations such asspina bifida limb defects and heart and kidney problems Amniocentesis This test is usually done between the th and th weeks of pregnancy A small sample ofamniotic fluid is withdrawn through a thin needleinserted into the mothers abdomen Chromosomalanalysis can rule out Down syndrome and other geneticconditions Chorionic villus sampling CVS This test can be done as early as the ninth week of pregnancy to identifychromosome disorders and some genetic conditions Athin needle is inserted through the abdomen or a slimtube is inserted through the vagina that takes a tiny tissue sample for testing If a birth defect is suspected after a baby is born then confirmation of the diagnosis is very important Thepatients medical records and medical history may holdessential information A careful physical examination and laboratory tests should be done Special diagnostictests can also provide genetic information in some cases Treatment Treatment depends on the type of birth defect and how serious it is When an abnormality has been identified before birth then delivery can be planned at a healthcare facility that is prepared to offer any special careneeded Some abnormalities can be corrected withsurgery Experimental procedures have been used successfully in correcting some defects like excessive fluidin the brain hydrocephalus even

bees and wasps snakes and marine animals suchas jellyfish and stingrays Description Mammals DOGS In the United States where the dog popula tion exceeds million dogs surpass all other mammalsin the number of bites inflicted on humans Howevermost dogbite injuries are minor A telephone survey ofUS households conducted in led researchers toestimate that dog bites not requiring medicalattention occurred in the United States that year versus that did require medical treatment Studies alsoshow that most dog bites are from pets or other dogsknown to the bitten person that males are more likelythan females to be bitten and that children face a greaterrisk than adults Each year about Americansmostly children under years of age are killed by dogs Dog bites result in an estimated emergency room visits annually throughout the United States Morethan half of the bites seen by emergency departmentsoccur at home Children under years old especiallyboys between and years of age are more likely thanolder people to visit an emergency room for bite treatment Children under years old were also much moreliable to be bitten on the face neck and head Nearly allof the injuries suffered by people seeking treatment inemergency rooms were of low severity and most weretreated and released without being admitted to hospital orsent to another facility Many of the bites resulted frompeople attempting to break up fights between animals CATS Although cats are found in nearly a third of US households cat bites are far less common than dogbites According to one study cats inflict perhaps harmful bites in the United States each year Thetissue damage caused by cat bites is usually limited butthey carry a high risk of infection Whereas the infectionrate for dog bite injuries is the infection rate forcat bites is A typical person who has been bittenis a young girl playing with a pet HUMANS Bites from mammals other than dogs and cats are uncommon with one exceptionhuman bitesThere are approximately human bites each yearin the United States Because the human mouth containsa multitude of potentially harmful microorganismshuman bites are more infectious than those of most otheranimals Arthropods Arthropods are invertebrates belonging to the phy lum Arthropoda which includes insects arachnids crustaceans and other subgroups There are more than species in all The list of arthropods that bite orsting humans is extensive and includes lice bedbugsfleas mosquitoes black flies ants chiggers ticks centipedes scorpions and other species Spiders bees andwasps are the three kinds of arthropod that most oftenbite people SPIDERS In the United States only two kinds of ven omous spider are truly dangerous widow spiders andbrown violin or fiddle spiders The black widow whichis found in every state but Alaska is probably the mostnotorious widow spider It prefers dark dry places such asbarns garages and outhouses and also lives under rocksand logs Disturbing a female black widow or its webmay provoke a bite Brown spiders also prefer shelteredplaces including clothing and may bite if disturbed GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bites and stingsGEM to B PM Page BEES AND WASPS Bees and wasps will sting to defend their nests or if they are disturbed Species common to the United States include honeybees bumblebees yellow jackets baldfaced hornets brown hornetsand paper wasps Of note are also Africanized beespecies also called killer bees that are now found inthe United States since More than fifty Americansdie each year after being stung by a bee wasp or antAlmost all of those deaths are the result of allergic reactions and not of exposure to the venom itself Snakes There are species of venomous snakes in the United States These snakes are found in every stateexcept Maine Alaska and Hawaii Each year about Americans receive a venomous snakebite but nomore than about die mostly from rattlesnake bites The venomous snakes of the United States are divid ed into two families the Crotalidae pit vipers and theElapidae Pit vipers named after the small heatsensingpit that lies between each eye and nostril are responsiblefor about of the venomous snakebites suffered byAmericans Rattlesnakes copperheads and cottonmouthsalso called water moccasins are pit vipers This familyof snakes delivers its venom through two long hingedfangs in the upper jaw Some pit vipers carry a potentvenom that can threaten the brain and spinal cord Thevenom of others such as the copperheads is less harmful The Elapidae family includes two kinds of ven omous coral snakes indigenous to the southern and western states Because coral snakes are bashful creaturesthat come out only at night they almost never bitehumans and are responsible for approximately bites ayear in the United States Coral snakes also have shortfangs and a small mouth which lowers the risk of a biteactually forcing venom into a persons body Howevertheir venom is quite poisonous Marine animals Several varieties of marine animal may bite or sting Jellyfish and stingrays are two kinds that pose a threat topeople who live or vacation in coastal communities Causes and symptoms Mammals DOGS A typical dog bite results in a laceration tear puncture or crush injury Bites from large powerful dogsmay even cause fractures and dangerous internal injuries Also dogs trained to attack may bite repeatedlyduring a single episode Infected bites usually cause pain cellulitis inflammation of the connective tissues and apusfilled discharge at the wound site within hours Most infections are confined to the wound site but manyof the microorganisms in the mouths of dogs can causesystemic and possibly lifethreatening infections Examples are bacteremia and meningitis especially severe in people diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syn drome AIDS or other health condition that increases their susceptibility to infection Rabies is rare among pet dogs in the United States most of which have been vaccinated against the disease Tetanus is also rare but can be transmitted by a dog bite if the victim is not immunized CATS The mouths of cats and dogs contain many of the same microorganisms Cat scratches and bites arealso capable of transmitting the Bartonella henselae bac terium which can lead to catscratch disease a n unpleasant but usually not lifethreatening illness Cat bites are mostly found on the arms and hands Sharp cat teeth typically leave behind a deep puncturewound that can reach muscles tendons and bones whichare vulnerable to infection because of their comparativelypoor blood supply This is why cat bites are much morelikely to become infected than dog bites Also people areless inclined to view cat bites as dangerous requiringimmediate attention the risk that infection has set in bythe time a medical professional is consulted is thus greater HUMANS Humans bites result from fights sexual activity medical and dental treatment and seizures Bitesalso raise the possibility of spousal or child abuse Chil dren often bite other children but those bites are hardlyever severe Human bites are capable of transmitting awide range of dangerous diseases including hepatitis B syphilis and tuberculosis Human bites fall into two categories occlusional true bites and clenchedfist injuries The former presenta lower risk of infection The latter which are very infectious and can permanently damage the hand usuallyresult from a fist hitting teeth during a fight People oftenwait before seeking treatment for a clenchedfist injurywith the result that about half of such injuries are infected by the time they are seen by a medical professional Arthropods SPIDERS As a rule people rarely see a black widow bite nor do they feel the bite as it occurs The first andpossibly only evidence that a person has been bitten maybe a mild swelling of the injured area and two red puncture marks Within a short time however some victimsbegin to experience severe muscle cramps and rigidity ofthe abdominal muscles Other possible symptoms includeexcessive sweating nausea vomiting headaches andvertigo as well as breathing vision and speech problems GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bites and stingsGEM to B PM Page A brown spiders bite can lead to necrotic arachni dism in which the tissue in an area of up to several inches around the bite becomes necrotic dies producing anopen sore that can take months or years to disappear Inmost cases however the bite simply produces a hardpainful itchy and discolored area that heals withouttreatment in days The bite may also be accompaniedby a fever chills edema an accumulation of excess tis sue fluid nausea and vomiting dizziness muscle and joint pain and a rash BEES AND WASPS The familiar symptoms of bee and wasp stings include pain redness swelling and itchiness in the area of the sting Multiple stings can havemuch more severe consequences such as anaphylaxis a lifethreatening allergic reaction that occurs in hypersensitive persons Snakes Venomous pit viper bites usually begin to swell within minutes and sometimes are painful Othersymptoms include skin blisters and discoloration weakness sweating nausea faintness dizziness bruising andtender lymph nodes Severe poisoning can also lead to tingling in the scalp fingers and toes muscle contractions an elevated heart rate rapid breathing large dropsin body temperature and blood pressure vomiting ofblood and coma Many pit viper and coral snake bites fail to poison envenomate their victim or introduce only asmall amount of venom into the victims body Thewounds however can still become infected by the harm ful microorganisms that snakes carry in their mouths Coral snake bites are painful but may be hard to see One to seven hours after the bite a bitten person begins toexperience the effects of the venom which include tinglingat the wound site weakness nausea vomiting excessivesalivation and irrational behavior Major nerves of thebody can become paralyzed for days causing doublevision difficulty swallowing and speaking respiratory failure and other problems Six to eight weeks may be needed before normal muscular strength is regained Marine animals JELLYFISH Jellyfish venom is delivered by barbs called nematocysts which are located on the creaturestentacles and penetrate the skin of people who brush upagainst them Instantly painful and itchy red lesions usually result The pain can continue up to hours Severecases may lead to skin necrosis muscle spasms and cramps vomiting nausea diarrhea headaches excessive sweating and other symptoms In rare instances cardiorespiratory failure may also occur STINGRAYS Tail spines are the delivery mechanism for stingray venom Deep puncture wounds result that cancause an infection if pieces of spine become embedded inthe wound A typical stingray injury scenario involves aperson who inadvertently steps on a resting stingray and islashed in the ankle by its tail Stingray venom producesimmediate excruciating pain that lasts several hoursSometimes the victim suffers a severe reaction includingvomiting diarrhea hemorrhage bleeding a drop in bloodpressure and cardiac arrhythmia disordered heart beat Diagnosis Mammals DOGS Gathering information on the circumstances of a dog attack is a crucial part of treatment Medicalprofessionals need to know when the attack occurred thechances of infection increase dramatically if the woundhas been left untreated for more than eight hours andwhat led to the attack unprovoked attacks are more likely to be associated with rabies A persons general healthmust also be assessed including the tetanus immunization history if any as well as information concerningpossible allergies to medication and preexisting health problems that may increase the risk of infection A physical examination requires careful scrutiny of the wound with special attention to possible bone jointligament muscle tendon nerve or bloodvessel damagecaused by deep punctures or severe crush injuries Serious hand injuries should be evaluated by a specializedsurgeon Most of the time laboratory tests for identifyingthe

supply important data on the victims condition Chest xrays and electrocardiography a procedure for measur ing heart activity may also be necessary Treatment Mammals DOGS Minor dog bites can be treated at home The American Academy of Family Physicians recommendsgently washing the wound with soap and water and thenapplying pressure to the injured area with a clean towel to stop the bleeding The next step is to apply antibioticointment and a sterile bandage to the wound To reduceswelling and fend off infection ice should be applied andthe injured area kept elevated above the level of the heartThe wound should be cleaned and covered with ointmenttwice a day until it heals Any dog bite that does not stop bleeding after minutes of pressure must be seen by a medical professional The same is true for bites that are deep or gapingfor bites to the head hands or feet and for bites thatmay have broken a bone damaged nerves or caused amajor injury of another kind Bite victims must alsowatch for

in five years and anyone else who has a medical problemthat can increase susceptibility to infection should seekmedical treatment no matter how minor the bite appears Medical treatment of dog bites involves washing the wound with an antiinfective solution Removal of deadand damaged tissue under local regional or generalanesthetic may be required after the wound has beenwashed and any person whose tetanus shots are not up todate should receive a booster injection Some wounds areleft open and allowed to heal on their own while othersrequire stitches stitching may be delayed a few days

name for coal workers pneumoconiosis CWP or anthracosis alung disease of older workers in the coal industrycaused by inhalation over many years of smallamounts of coal dust Description The risk of having black lung disease is directly related to the amount of dust inhaled over the years thedisease typically affects workers over age Its common name comes from the fact that the inhalation ofheavy deposits of coal dust makes miners lungs lookblack instead of a healthy pink Although people wholive in cities often have some black deposits in theirlungs from polluted air coal miners have much moreextensive depositsIn the years since the federal government has regu lated dust levels in coal mines the number of cases ofblack lung disease has fallen sharply Since the FederalCoal Mine Health and Safety Act of average dustlevels have fallen from mg per cubic meter to thecurrent standard of mg per cubic meter The law also set up a black lung disability benefits programto compensate coal miners who have been disabled byonthejob dust exposure Despite the technology available to control the hazard however miners still run the risk of developing this lung disease The risk is much lower todayhowever fewer than of coal miners have any xray evidence of coal dust deposits When there is suchevidence it often shows up as only small black spotsless than in cm in diameter and may havebeen caused by smoking rather than coal dust This condition is called simple CWP and does not lead tosymptoms or disability Causes and symptoms Since the particles of fine coal dust which a miner breathes when he is in the mines cannot be destroyedwithin the lungs or removed from them builds up Eventually this buildup causes thickening and scarringmaking the lungs less efficient in supplying oxygen tothe blood The primary symptom of the disease is shortness of breath which gradually gets worse as the disease pro gresses In severe cases the patient may develop cor pul monale an enlargement and strain of the right side of the heart caused by chronic lung disease This may eventually cause rightsided heart failure GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Black lung disease A light micrograph of a human

complication of black lung disease Othersdevelop a severe type of black lung disease called progressive massive fibrosis in which damage continues inthe upper parts of the lungs even after exposure to thedust has ended Scientists arent sure what causes thisserious complication Some think that it may be due tothe breathing of a mixture of coal and silica dust that isfound in certain mines Silica is far more likely to lead toscarring than coal dust alone Diagnosis Black lung disease can be diagnosed by checking a patients history for exposure to coal dust followed by achest xray to discover if the characteristic spots in thelungs caused by coal dust are present A pulmonary function test may aid in diagnosis X rays can detect black lung disease before it causes any symptoms If exposure to the dust is stopped at thatpoint progression of the disease may be prevented Treatment There is no treatment or cure for this condition although it is possible to treat complications such as lunginfections and cor pulmonale Further exposure to coaldust must be stoppedKEY TERMS Emphysema A disease in which the tiny air sacs in the lungs become damaged leading to shortness of breath and respiratory and heart failure Fibrosis The growth of scar tissue often as a response to injury infection or inflammation Pulmonary function test A group of procedures used to evaluate the function of

theirgrowth and start dividing uncontrollably This abnormalgrowth results in a mass of cells that form a tumor Description Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States The American Cancer Society ACSestimates that in approximately new casesof bladder cancer will be diagnosed and it will cause atleast deaths The disease is three times more common among men than women and the incidence is alsohigher in caucasians The urinary bladder is a hollow muscular organ that stores urine from the kidneys until it is excreted out ofthe body Two tubes called the ureters bring the urinefrom the kidneys to the bladder The urethra carries theurine from the bladder to the outside of the body Bladder cancer has a very high rate of recurrence Even after superficial tumors are completely removed GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bladder cancerGEM to B PM Page there is a chance that new tumors will develop in other areas of the bladder Hence patients need very frequent and thorough followup care Causes and symptoms Although the exact cause of bladder cancer is not known smokers are twice as likely as nonsmokers to getthe disease Hence smoking is considered the greatest risk factor for bladder cancer Workers who are exposedto certain chemicals that are used in the dye industry andin the rubber leather textile and paint industries arebelieved to be at a higher risk for bladder cancer The disease is also three times more common in men than inwomen caucasians also are at an increased risk The riskof bladder cancer increases with age Most cases arefound in people who are years old Frequent urinary infections kidney and bladder stones and other conditions that cause longterm irrita tion to the bladder may increase the risk of getting bladder cancer A past history of tumors in the bladder couldalso increase ones risk of getting other tumors One of the first warning signals of bladder cancer is blood in the urine Sometimes there is enough blood in theurine to change the color of the urine to a yellowred or adark red At other times the color of the urine appears normal but chemical testing of the urine reveals the presenceof blood cells A change in bladder habits such as painfulurination increased frequency of urination and a feeling of needing to urinate but not being able to do so are some ofthe signs of possible bladder cancer All of these symptomsmay also be caused by conditions other than cancer but itis important to see a doctor and have the symptoms evaluated When detected early and treated appropriately patientshave a very good chance of being cured completely Diagnosis If a doctor has any reason to suspect bladder cancer he may use several tests to find out if the disease is present Asa first step a complete medical history will be taken tocheck for any risk factors A thorough physical examina tion will be conducted to assess all the signs and symp toms Laboratory testing of a urine sample will help to ruleout the presence of a bacterial infection In a urine cytologytest the urine is examined under a microscope to look forany abnormal or cancerous cells A catheter tube can beadvanced into the bladder through the urethra and a saltsolution is passed through it to wash the bladder The solution can then be collected and examined under a microscope to check for the presence of any cancerous cells A test known as the intravenous pyelogram IVP is an xray examination that is done after a dye is injectedinto the blood stream through a vein in the arm The dyetravels through the blood stream and then reaches

bladder Illustration by Argosy IncGEM to B PM Page ureters bladder and urethra Multiple x rays are taken to detect any abnormality in the lining of these organs The physician may use a procedure known as a cys toscopy to view the inside of the bladder A thin hollow lighted tube is introduced into the bladder through theurethra If any suspicious looking masses are seen asmall piece of the tissue can be removed from it using apair of biopsy forceps The tissue is then examinedmicroscopically to verify if cancer is present and if so toidentify the type of cancer If cancer is detected and there is evidence to indicate that it has metastasized spread to distant sites in the bodyimaging tests such as chest x rays computed tomography scans CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI may be done to determine which organs are affected Bladdercancer generally tends to spread to the lungs liver and bone Treatment Treatment for bladder cancer depends on the stage of the tumor The patients medical history overall healthstatus and personal preferences are also taken intoaccount when deciding on an appropriate treatment planThe three standard modes of treatment that are availablefor bladder cancer are surgery radiation therapy and chemotherapy In addition newer treatment methods such as photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy arealso being investigated in clinical trials Surgery is considered an option only when the disease is in its early stages If the tumor is localized to a small areaand has not spread to the inner layers of the bladder thenthe surgery is done without cutting open the abdomen Acytoscope is introduced into the bladder through the urethra and the tumor is removed through it This procedure iscalled a transurethral resection TUR Passing a highenergy laser beam through the cytoscope and burning the cancer may treat any remaining cancer This procedure isknown as electrofulguration If the cancer has invaded thewalls of the bladder surgery will be done through an incision in the abdomen Cancer that is not very large can beremoved by partial cystectomy a procedure where a part of the bladder is removed If the cancer is large or is presentin more than one area of the bladder a radical cystectomyis done In this operation besides the entire bladder theadjoining organs may also be removed In men the prostateis removed while in women the uterus ovaries and fallopian tubes are removed If the entire urinary bladder is removed then an alter nate storage place must be created for the urine to bestored before it is excreted out of the body To do this apiece of intestine is converted into a small bag andattached to the ureters This is then connected to an opening stoma that is made in the abdominal wall The proce dure is called a urostomy In some urostomy proceduresthe urine from the intestinal sac is routed into a bag that isplaced over the stoma in the abdominal wall The bag ishidden by the clothing and has to be emptied occasionallyby the patient In a different procedure the urine is collected in the intestinal sac but there is no bag on the outside ofthe abdomen The intestinal sac has to be emptied by thepatient by placing a drainage tube through the stoma Radiation therapy that uses highenergy rays to kill cancer cells is generally used after surgery to destroy anyremaining cancer cells that may not have been removedduring surgery If the tumor is in a location that makessurgery difficult or if it is large radiation may be usedbefore surgery to shrink the tumor In cases of advancedbladder cancer radiation therapy is used to ease thesymptoms such as pain bleeding or blockage Radiation can be delivered by external beam radiation where asource of radiation that is outside the body focuses theradiation on the area of the tumor Occasionally a smallpellet of radioactive material may be placed directly intothe cancer This is known as interstitial radiation therapy Chemotherapy uses anticancer drugs to destroy the cancer cells that may have migrated to distant sites Thedrugs are introduced into the bloodstream by injecting theminto a vein in the arm or taking them orally in pill formGenerally a combination of drugs is more effective than anysingle drug in treating bladder cancer Chemotherapy maybe given following surgery to kill any remaining cancercells It may also be given even when no remaining cancercells can be seen This is called adjuvant chemotherapyAnticancer drugs including thiotepa doxorubicin and mitomycin may also be instilled directly into the bladderintravesicular chemotherapy to treat superficial

bladder cancer Photodynamic treatment is a novel mode of treat ment that uses special chemicals and light to kill the cancerous cells First a drug is introduced into the bladderthat makes the cancer cells more susceptible to light Following that a special light is shone on the bladder in anattempt to destroy the cancerous cells Prognosis When detected at the early stages the prognosis for bladder cancer is excellent At least of the people GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bladder cancerGEM to B PM Page survive five years or more after initial diagnosis Howev er if the disease has spread to the nearby tissues the survival rates drop to If it has metastasized to distantorgans such as the lung and the liver commonly only of the patients will survive five years or more Prevention Since we do not know what exactly causes bladder cancer there is no certain way to prevent it Avoiding riskfactors whenever possible is the best alternative Since smoking doubles ones risk of getting bladder

much less common thankidney stones Description Bladder stones can form anywhere in the urinary tract before depositing in the bladder They begin as tinygranules about the size of a grain of sand but they cangrow to more than an inch in diameter These stones canblock the flow of urine causing pain and difficulty with urination They can also scratch the bladder wall whichmay lead to bleeding or infection Causes and symptoms While the exact causes of the formation of bladder stones are not completely understood bladder stonesusually occur because of urinary tract infection UTIobstruction of the urinary tract enlargement of theprostate gland in men or the presence of foreign bodiesin the urinary tract Diet and the amount of fluid intakealso appear to be important factors in the development ofbladder stones Ninetyfive percent of all bladder stones occur in men most of who have an enlarged prostate gland or a UTI These stones are rarely seen in children or inAfrican Americans People with gout may develop blad der stones composed almost entirely of uric acid The symptoms of bladder stones may become evi dent when the wall of the bladder is scratched or whenthe urinary tract becomes obstructed by the stone Thesesymptoms include abnormally dark colored urine blood in the urine difficulty urinating frequent urge to urinate lower abdominal pain pain or discomfort in the penis Some people with bladder stones also may experi ence an inability to control urination urinary inconti nence Diagnosis The diagnosis of bladder stones is usually made after a physical examination which may include a rectal exami nation to check for enlargement of the prostate gland Urine tests are then used to determine if there is blood orindications of an UTI in the urine If bladder stones are suspected bladder or pelvic x rays may be ordered Stones thatare large enough to cause problems with urinary functionare almost always detectable by x ray Treatment Many bladder stones can be passed out of the body in the urine People with small bladder stones will beasked to increase their fluid intakes to at least six to eighteightounce glasses of water per day to increase urinaryoutput If the stones do not pass after two weeks or if the GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bladder stonesGEM to B PM Page patients symptoms become worse further medical treat ment may be required A large bladder stone or small stone that the patient cannot pass in the urine may be broken up into smallerstones using ultrasound shock waves These smallerstones may then pass in the urine Stones that cannot bebroken into pieces by these methods or that the patientcannot pass may have to be surgically removed Alternative treatment Traditional herbal remedies for bladder stones include celery seed and horsetail Also because incomplete bladder emptying may cause bladder stones many patientsmay benefit from methods and remedies aimed at improving overall bladder function These include Kegel

tothe bladder or the rest of the urinary tract However mostbladder stones arise from an underlying medical condition Therefore if this medical condition is not correctedapproximately half of all patients will experience a recurrence of bladder stones within five years Prevention Bladder stones may in some cases be prevented by the patient receiving prompt medical treatment for anenlarged

lungs or also involve the skin and bones In itsmost severe form the infection can spread throughoutthe body and involve many organ systems systemic Description Blastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Blas tomyces dermatitidis Although primarily an airborne disease farmers and gardeners may become infectedfrom contact with spores in the soil through cuts andscrapes The fungus that causes the disease is found inmoist soil and wood in the southeastern United Statesthe Mississippi River valley southern Canada and Central America Blastomycosis is also called Gilchrists dis GALE

American blastomycosis but despite the similar name this disease is substantially different from North American blastomycosis Canine blastomycosis a common dog disease iscaused by the same fungus that infects humans However people do not get this disease from their dogs exceptonly very rarely through dog bites Blastomycosis is a rare disease infecting only about in every people It is at least six times morecommon in men than in women and tends to more ofteninfect children and individuals in the year old agegroup People who have diabetes mellitus or who are taking drugs that suppress the immune system immunocompromised are more likely to develop blastomycosisAlthough people with AIDS can get blastomycosis because of their weakened immune system blastomycosis has not been one of the more common fungal infections associated with AIDS Causes and symptoms Once inhaled the spores of B dermatitidis can lodge in the lungs and cause a localized inflammation This isknown as primary pulmonary blastomycosis The diseasedoes not spread from one person to another In the earlystages symptoms may include a dry cough fever heavy sweating fatigue and a general feeling of ill health In approximately of blastomycosis cases only thelungs are affected As the disease progresses smalllesions form in the lungs causing the air sacs deep withinthe lungs alveoli to break down and form small cavities In another the disease involves both the lungs and the skin Bumps develop on the skin graduallybecoming small white crusted blisters filled with pusThe blisters break open creating abscesses that do notheal Approximately of infected people have skinsores without infection in the lungs The remaining approximately of the infected population has blastomycosis that has spread or disseminated to other systems of the body Symptoms mayinclude pain and lesions on one or more bones the male genitalia andor parts of the central nervous system Theliver spleen lymph nodes heart adrenal glands anddigestive system may also be infected Diagnosis A positive diagnosis of blastomycosis is made when the fungus B dermatitidis is identified by direct micro scopic examination of body fluids such as sputum andprostate fluid or in tissue samples biopsies from thelung or skin Another way to diagnose blastomycosis is to culture and isolate the fungus from a sample of sputum Chest x rays are used to assess lung damage butalone cannot lead to a definitive diagnosis of blastomycosis because any damage caused by other diseases suchas by pneumonia or tuberculosis may appear look on the x ray Because its symptoms vary widely blastomycosis is often misdiagnosed Treatment Blastomycosis must be treated or it will gradually lead to death Treatment with the fungicidal drug keto conazole Nizoral taken orally is effective in about of patients Amphotericin B Fungizone given intravenously is also very effective but it has more toxic sideeffects than ketoconazole Treatment with amphotericinB usually requires hospitalization and the patient mayalso receive other drugs to minimize the its side effects Alternative treatment Alternative treatment for fungal infections focuses on creating an internal environment where the funguscannot survive This is accomplished by eating a diet lowin dairy products sugars including honey and fruit juiceand foods like beer that contain yeast This is complemented by a diet consisting in large part of uncookedand unprocessed foods Supplements of vitamins C E Aplus and B complex may also be useful Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium will replenish the

recoveryis among patients who only have skin lesions People with the disseminated form of the disease are least likelyto be cured and and most likely to suffer a relapse Prevention Because the fungus

bleeding It indicates how well plateletsinteract with blood vessel walls to form blood clots Purpose Bleeding time is used most often to detect qualitative defects of platelets such as V on Willebrands disease Thetest helps identify people who have defects in theirplatelet function This is the ability of blood to clot following a wound or trauma Normally platelets interactwith the walls of blood vessels to cause a blood clotThere are many factors in the clotting mechanism andthey are initiated by platelets The bleeding time test isusually used on patients who have a history of prolongedbleeding after cuts or who have a family history of bleeding disorders Also the bleeding time test is sometimesperformed as a preoperative test to determine a patientslikely bleeding response during and after surgery However in patients with no history of bleeding problems orwho are not taking antiinflammatory drugs the bleedingtime test is not usually necessary Precautions Before administering the test patients should be questioned about what medications they may be takingSome medications will adversely affect the results of thebleeding time test These medications include anticoagulants diuretics anticancer drugs sulfonamides thi azide aspirin and aspirincontaining preparations and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs The test may also be affected by anemia a deficiency in red bloodcells Since the taking of aspirin or related drugs are themost common cause of prolonged bleeding time noaspirin should be taken two weeks prior to the test GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bleeding timeGEM to B PM Page Description There are four methods to perform the bleeding test The Ivy method is the traditional format for thistest In the Ivy method a blood pressure cuff is placedon the upper arm and inflated to mM Hg A lancet orscalpel blade is used to make a stab wound on theunderside of the forearm An automatic springloadedblade device is most commonly used to make a standardsized cut The area stabbed is selected so that nosuperficial or visible veins are cut These veins becauseof their size may have longer bleeding times especially in people with bleeding defects The time from whenthe stab wound is made until all bleeding has stopped ismeasured and is called the bleeding time Every seconds filter paper or a paper towel is used to draw offthe blood The test is finished when bleeding hasstopped completely The three other methods of performing the bleeding test are the template modified template and Dukemethods The template and modified template methodsare variations of the Ivy method A blood pressure cuffis used and the skin on the forearm prepared as in theIvy method A template is placed over the area to bestabbed and two incisions are made in the forearm usingthe template as a location guide The main differencebetween the template and the modified method is thelength of the cut made For the Duke method a nick is made in an ear lobe or a fingertip is pricked to cause bleeding As in the Ivymethod the test is timed from the start of bleeding untilbleeding is completely stopped The disadvantage to theDuke method is that the pressure on the blood veins inthe stab area is not constant and the results achieved areless reliable The advantage to the Duke method is thatno scar remains after the test The other methods mayresult in a tiny hairline scar where the wound was madeHowever this is largely a cosmetic concern Preparation There is no special preparation required of the patient for this test The area to be stabbed should bewiped clean with an alcohol pad The alcohol should beleft on the skin long enough for it to kill bacteria at thewound site The alcohol must be removed before stabbing the arm because alcohol will adversely affect thetests results by inhibiting clotting Aftercare If a prolonged bleeding time is caused by unknown factors or diseases further testing is required to identifythe exact cause of the bleeding problemKEY TERMS Hemostasis The stopping of bleeding or blood flow through a blood vessel or organ Normal results A normal bleeding time for the Ivy method is less than five minutes from the time of the stab until allbleeding from the wound stops Some texts extend thenormal range to eight minutes Normal values for thetemplate method range up to eight minutes while forthe modified template methods up to minutes isconsidered normal Normal for the Duke method isthree minutes Abnormal results A bleeding time that is longer than normal is an abnormal result The test should be stopped if the patienthasnt stopped bleeding by minutes Bleeding timeis longer when the normal function of platelets isimpaired or there are a lowerthannormal number ofplatelets in the blood A longerthannormal

part of thestomach caused by liver disease GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bleeding varicesGEM to B PM Page Description Engorged veins are called varices plural of varix Varices may occur in the lining of the esophagus thetube that connects the mouth to the stomach or in theupper part of the stomach Such varices are calledesophageal varices These varices are fragile and canbleed easily because veins are not designed to handlehigh internal pressures Causes and symptoms Liver disease often causes an increase in the blood pressure in the main veins that carry blood from thestomach and intestines to the liver portal veins As thepressure in the portal veins increases the veins of thestomach and esophagus swell until they eventuallybecome varices Bleeding varices are a lifethreateningcomplication of this increase in blood pressure portalhypertension The most common cause of bleeding varices is cirrhosis of the liver caused by chronic alcohol abuse or hepatitis Bleeding varices occur in approximately one in every people Symptoms of bleeding varices include vomiting blood sometimes in massive amounts black tarry stools decreased urine outputKEY TERMS Cirrhosis of the liver A type of liver disease most often caused by chronic alcohol abuse It is characterized by scarring of the liver which leads to anincrease in the blood pressure in the portal veins Endoscopy Medical imaging technique for visual izing the interior of a hollow organ Esophagus The tube in the body which takes food from the mouth to the stomach Esophagogastroduodenoscopy EGD An imaging test that involves visually examining the lining ofthe esophagus stomach and upper duodenum witha flexible fiberoptic endoscope Portal hypertension Portal hypertension forces the blood flow backward causing the portal veins toenlarge and the emergence of bleeding varicesacross the esophagus and stomach from the pressurein the portal vein Portal hypertension is most commonly caused by cirrhosis but can also be seen inportal vein obstruction from unknown causesPortal veins The main veins that carry blood from the stomach and intestines to the liver Shock A state of depression of the vital processes of the body characterized by pallor a rapid andweak pulse rapid and shallow respiration and lowered blood pressure Shock results from severe trauma such as crushing injuries hemorrhage burnsor major surgery Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt TIPS A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt TIPS is a radiology procedure in which atubular device is inserted in the middle of the liverto redirect the blood flow Varices A type of varicose vein that develops in veins in the linings of the esophagus and upper stomach when these veins fill with blood and swell due toan increase in blood pressure in the portal veins excessive thirst nausea vomiting and blood in the vomit If bleeding from the varices is severe a patient may go into shock from the loss of blood characterized by pallor a rapid and weak pulse rapid and shallow respiration and lowered systemic blood pressure Diagnosis Bleeding varices may be suspected in a patient who has any of the abovementioned symptoms and who haseither been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver or whohas a history of prolonged alcohol abuse The definitivediagnosis is established via a specialized type of endoscopy namely esophagogastroduodenoscopy EGD a procedure that involves the visual examination of the lining of the esophagus stomach and upper duodenumwith a flexible fiberoptic endoscope Treatment The objective during treatment of bleeding varices is to stop andor prevent bleeding and to restoremaintainnormal blood circulation throughout the body Patientswith severe bleeding should be treated in intensive caresince uncontrolled bleeding can lead to death GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bleeding varicesGEM to B PM Page Initial treatment of bleeding varices begins with stan dard resuscitation including intravenous fluids and bloodtransfusions as needed Definitive treatment is usuallyendoscopic with the endoscope used to locate the sites ofthe bleeding An instrument inserted along with the endoscope is used either to inject these sites with a clottingagent or to tie off the bleeding sites with tiny rubber bands Repeated endoscopic treatments usually four to six are generally required to eliminate the varices and to prevent the recurrence of bleeding These endoscopic techniques are successful in about percent of cases Patients who cannot be treated endoscopically may be considered for an alternative procedure called TIPStransjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt This procedure involves placing a hollow metal tube shunt inthe liver connecting the portal veins with the hepaticveins veins that leave the liver and drain to the heartThis shunt lowers the pressure in the portal veins andprevents bleeding and portal hypertension The TIPS procedure is performed by a radiologist and has become anaccepted method for reducing portal vein pressure since Although the procedure continues to evolve TIPScan routinely be created in more than of patients Medications aimed at controlling bleeding may also be prescribed These include propanolol vasopressinoctreotide acetate and isosorbide mononitrate Alternative treatment Some alternative treatments are aimed at preventing the cirrhosis of the liver that often causes bleeding varicesand most are effective However once a patient hasreached the bleeding varice stage standard intervention tostop the bleeding is required or the patient may die Prognosis Bleeding varices represent one of the most feared complications of portal hypertension They contribute tothe estimated deaths per year attributed to cirrhosis Half or more of patients who survive episodes ofbleeding varices are at risk of renewed esophageal bleeding during the first one to two years The risk of recurrence can be lowered by endoscopic and drug treatmentPrognosis is usually more related to the underlying liverdisease Approximately to percent of people withbleeding varices will die from this condition within thesix weeks of the first bleeding episode Prevention The best way to possibly prevent the development or recurrence of bleeding varices is to eliminate the risk factors for cirrhosis of the liver The most common cause ofcirrhosis is prolonged alcohol abuse and alcohol consumption must be completely eliminated People with hepatitis B or hepatitis C also have an increased risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver Vaccination

surgical procedure that removes fat deposits excess tissue or muscle from theeyelids to improve the appearance of the eyes Purpose The primary use of blepharoplasty is for improving the cosmetic appearance of the eyes In some olderpatients however sagging and excess skin surroundingthe eyes can be so extensive that it limits the range ofvision In those cases blepharoplasty serves a more functional purpose Precautions Before performing blepharoplasty the surgeon will assess whether the patient is a good candidate for the GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BlepharoplastyGEM to B PM Page treatment A good medical history is important The sur geon will want to know about any history of thyroid disease hypertension or eye problems which may increase the risk of complications Description Blepharoplasty can be performed on the upper or lower eyelid it can involve the removal of excess skinand fat deposits and the tightening of selected musclessurrounding the eyelids The goal is to provide a moreyouthful appearance The surgeon will begin by deciding whether excess skin fat deposits or muscle looseness are at fault Whilethe patient is sitting upright the surgeon will mark on theskin where incisions will be made Care will be taken tohide the incision lines in the natural skin folds above andbelow the eye The patient then receives injections of alocal anesthetic to numb the pain Many surgeons also give the patient a sedative intravenously during the procedure After a small crescentshaped section of eyelid skin is removed the surgeon will work to tease out smallpockets of fat that have collected in the lids If musclelooseness is also a problem the surgeon may trim tissueor add a stitch to pull it tighter Then the incision isclosed with stitches In some patients fat deposits in the lower eyelid may be the only or primary problem Such patients may begood candidates for transconjunctival blepharoplasty Inthis procedure the surgeon makes no incision on the surface of the eyelid but instead enters from behind to teaseout the fat deposits from a small incision The advantageof this procedure is that there is no visible scar Preparation Prior to surgery patients meet with their surgeon to discuss the procedure clarify the results that can beachieved and discuss the potential problems that mightoccur Having realistic expectations is important in anycosmetic procedure Patients will learn for example thatalthough blepharoplasty can improve the appearance ofthe eyelid other procedures such as a chemical peelwill be necessary to reduce the appearance of wrinklesaround the eye Some surgeons prescribe vitamin C andvitamin K for days prior to surgery in the belief thatthis helps the healing process Patients are also told tostop smoking in the weeks before and after the proce dure and to refrain from alcohol and aspirin Aftercare An antibiotic ointment is applied to the line of stitch es for several days after surgery Patients also take an GALE

alcoholic beverages for one week and should limit their activitiesincluding bending straining and lifting The stitches areremoved a few days after surgery Patients can generallyreturn to their usual activities within a week to days Risks As with any surgical procedure blepharoplasty can lead to infection and scarring Good care of the wound following surgery can minimize these risks In cases wheretoo much skin is removed from the eyelids the patientmay have difficulty closing his eyes Dry eye syndromemay develop requiring the use of artificial tears to lubricate the eye In a rare complication called retrobulbarhematoma a pocket of blood forms behind the eyeball Normal results Most patients can expect good results from blepharo plasty with the removal of excess eyelid skin and fat producing a more youthful appearance Some swelling anddiscoloration is expected immediately following the procedure but this clears in time Small scars will be leftwhere the surgeon has made incisions but these generallylighten in appearance over several months and if placedcorrectly will not be readily noticeable Abnormal results As noted if too much excess skin is removed from the upper eyelid the patient may be unable to close hiseyes completely another surgery to correct the defectmay be required Similarly too much skin can beremoved from the lower eyelid allowing too much of thewhite of the eye the sclera to show In extreme casesthe lower lid may be pulled down too far revealing theunderlying tissue Called an ectropion this too mayrequire a second corrective surgery The

and diagnostic test that is often done as part of a routine physical examina tion It can provide valuable information about the blood and bloodforming tissues especially the bone marrowas well as other body systems Abnormal results can indicate the presence of a variety of conditionsincludinganemias leukemias and infectionssometimes before the patient experiences symptoms of the disease Description A complete blood count is actually a series of tests in which the numbers of red blood cells white bloodcells and platelets in a given volume of blood are counted The CBC also measures the hemoglobin content andthe packed cell volume hematocrit of the red blood cells assesses the size and shape of the red blood cellsand determines the types and percentages of white bloodcells Components of the complete blood count hemoglobin hematocrit white blood cells platelets etc canalso be tested separately and are sometimes done thatway when a doctor wants to monitor a specific conditionsuch as the white cell count of a patient diagnosed withleukemia or the hemoglobin of a patient who has recently received a blood transfusion Because of its value though as an indicator of a persons overall health theCBC package is most frequently ordered The blood count is performed relatively inexpen sively and quickly Most laboratories routinely use sometype of automated equipment to dilute the blood samplea measured volume of the diluted suspension and countthe cells in that volume In addition to counting actualnumbers of red cells white cells and platelets the automated cell counters also measure the hemoglobin andcalculate the hematocrit and the red blood cell indices measures of the size and hemoglobin content of the redblood cells Technologists then examine a stained bloodsmear under the microscope to identify any abnormalities in the appearance of the red blood cells and to reportthe types and percentages of white blood cells observedThe red blood cell RBC count determines the total number of red cells erythrocytes in a sample of bloodThe red cells the most numerous of the cellular elements carry oxygen from the lungs to the bodys tissuesHemoglobin Hgb is the proteiniron compound in thered blood cells that enables them to transport oxygen Itsconcentration corresponds closely to the RBC countAlso closely tied to the RBC and hemoglobin values isthe hematocrit Hct which measures the percentage ofred blood cells in the total blood volume The hematocritexpressed as percentage points is normally about threetimes the hemoglobin concentration reported as gramsper deciliter Red blood cell indices provide information about the size and hemoglobin content of the red cells They areuseful in differentiating types of anemias The indicesinclude four measurements that are calculated using theRBC count hemoglobin and hematocrit results Meancorpuscular volume MCV is a measurement of the average size of the red blood cells and indicates whether thatis small large or normal The red blood cell distributionwidth RDW is an indication of the variation in RBCsize Mean corpuscular hemoglobin MCH measures theaverage amount weight of hemoglobin within a redblood cell A similar measurement mean corpuscularhemoglobin concentration MCHC expresses the average concentration of hemoglobin in the red blood cells The white blood cell WBC count

Wrights stain allowing the different types ofwhite cells to be clearly seen under the microscope Atechnologist then counts a minimum of WBCs andreports each type of white cell as a percentage of the totalwhite blood cells counted The platelet count is an actual count of the number of platelets thrombocytes in a given volume of bloodPlatelets the smallest of the cellular elements of bloodare involved in blood clotting Because platelets canclump together the automated counting method is subject to a certain level of error and may not be accurateenough for low platelet counts For this reason very lowplatelet levels are often counted manually Normal results Blood count values can vary by age and sex The normal red blood cell count ranges from millionRBCs per microliter of blood for men and million for women Hemoglobin values range from grams per deciliter of blood for men and grams forwomen The normal hematocrit is for men and for women The normal number of white bloodcells for both men and women is approximately WBCs per microliter of blood Abnormal results Abnormal blood count results are seen in a variety of conditions One of the most common is anemias whichare

laboratory to find and identify any microorganismpresent and growing in the blood If a microorganism isfound more testing is done to determine the antibiotics that will be effective in treating the infection Purpose Bacteremia is a serious clinical condition and can lead to death To give the best chance for effective treat ment and survival a blood culture is done as soon as aninfection is suspected Symptoms of bacteremia are fever chills mental confusion anxiety rapid heart beat hyperventilation blood clotting problems and shock These symptoms are especially significant in a person who already has another illness or infection is hospitalized or has troublefighting infections because of a weak immune systemOften the blood infection results from an infectionsomewhere else in the body that has now spread Additionally blood cultures are done to find the causes of other infections These include bacterial pneu monia an infection of the lung and infectious endo carditis an infection of the inner layer of the heart Both of these infections leak bacteria into the blood After a blood infection has been diagnosed con firmed by culture and treated an additional blood culture may be done to make sure the infection is gone Description Culture strategies There are many variables involved in performing a blood culture Before the persons blood is drawn thephysician must make several decisions based on a knowledge of infections and the persons clinical condition andmedical history Several groups of microorganisms including bacte ria viruses mold and yeast can cause blood infectionsThe bacteria group can be further broken down into aerobes and anaerobes Most aerobes do not need oxygen tolive They can grow with oxygen aerobic microbes orwithout oxygen anaerobic microbes Based on the clinical condition of the patient the physician determines what group of microorganisms islikely to be causing the infection and then orders one or GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Blood cultureGEM to B PM Page more specific types of blood culture including aerobic anaerobic viral or fungal for yeasts and molds Eachspecific type of culture is handled differently by the laboratory Most blood cultures test for both aerobic andanaerobic microbes Fungal viral and mycobacterialblood cultures can also be done but are less common The physician must also decide how many blood cultures should be done One culture is rarely enoughbut two to three are usually adequate Four cultures areoccasionally required Some factors influencing thisdecision are the specific microorganisms the physicianexpects to find based on the persons symptoms or previous culture results and whether or not the person has hadrecent antibiotic therapy The time at which the cultures are to be drawn is another decision made by the physician During mostblood infections called intermittent bacteremia microorganisms enter the blood at various time intervals Blooddrawn randomly may miss the microorganisms Sincemicroorganisms enter the blood minutes before thepersons fever spikes collecting the culture just after thefever spike offers the best likelihood of finding themicroorganism The second and third cultures may becollected at the same time but from different places onthe person or spaced at minute or onehour intervalsas the physician chooses During continuous bacteremiasuch as infective endocarditis microorganisms are alwaysin the blood and the timing of culture collection is lessimportant Blood cultures should always be collectedbefore antibiotic treatment has begun Laboratory analysis Bacteria are the most common microorganisms found in blood infections Laboratory analysis of a bacterial blood culture differs slightly from that of a fungalculture and significantly from that of a viral culture Blood is drawn from a person and put directly into a blood culture bottle containing a nutritional broth Afterthe laboratory receives the blood culture bottle severalprocesses must be completed provide an environment for the bacteria to grow detect the growth when it occurs identify the bacteria that grow test the bacteria against certain antibiotics to determine which antibiotic will be effective There are several types of systems both manual and automated available to laboratories to carry out theseprocesses The broth in the blood culture bottle is the first step in creating an environment in which bacteria will grow Itcontains all the nutrients that bacteria need to grow If the physician expects anaerobic bacteria to grow oxygenwill be kept out of the blood culture bottle if aerobes areexpected oxygen will be allowed in the bottle The bottles are placed in an incubator and kept at body temperature They are watched daily for signs ofgrowth including cloudiness or a color change in thebroth gas bubbles or clumps of bacteria When there isevidence of growth the laboratory does a gram stain anda subculture To do the gram stain a drop of blood isremoved from the bottle and placed on a microscopeslide The blood is allowed to dry and then is stained withpurple and red stains and examined under the microscope If bacteria are seen the color of stain they pickedup purple or red their shape such as round or rectangular and their size provide valuable clues as to whattype of microorganism they are and what antibioticsmight work best To do the subculture a drop of blood isplaced on a culture plate spread over the surface andplaced in an incubator If there is no immediate visible evidence of growth in the bottles the laboratory looks for bacteria by doinggram stains and subcultures These steps are repeateddaily for the first several days and periodically after that When bacteria grows the laboratory identifies it using biochemical tests and the gram stain Sensitivitytesting also called antibiotic susceptibility testing is alsodone The bacteria are tested against many differentantibiotics to see which antibiotics can effectively kill it All information is passed on to the physician as soon as it is known An early report known as a preliminaryreport is usually available after one day This report willtell if any bacteria have been found yet and if so theresults of the gram stain The next preliminary report mayinclude a description of the bacteria growing on the subculture The laboratory notifies the physician immediatelywhen an organism is found and as soon as sensitivity testsare complete Sensitivity tests may be complete before thebacteria is completely identified The final report may notbe available for five to seven days If bacteria was foundthe report will include its complete identification and alist of the antibiotics to which the bacteria is sensitive One automated system is considered one of the most important recent technical advances in blood cultures Itis called continuousmonitoring blood culture systemsCMCCS The instruments automatically monitor thebottles containing the patient blood for evidence ofmicroorganisms usually every minutes Many datapoints are collected daily for each bottle and fed into acomputer for analysis Sophisticated mathematical calculations can determine when microorganisms have grownThis combined with more frequent blood tests make it GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Blood cultureGEM to B PM Page possible to detect microbial growth earlier In addition all CMBCS instruments have the detection system incubator and agitation unit in one unit Preparation Ten ml milliliter of blood is usually needed for each blood culture bottle First a healthcare workerlocates a vein in the inner elbow region The area of skinwhere the blood will be drawn must be disinfected toprevent any microorganisms on a persons skin fromentering the blood culture bottle and contaminating itThe area is disinfected by wiping the area with alcohol ina circular fashion starting with tiny circles at the spotwhere the needle will puncture the skin and enlarging thesize of the circles while wiping away from the puncturesite The same pattern of wiping is repeated using aniodine or iodophor solution The top of the bottle is disinfected using alcohol After the persons skin has beendisinfected the healthcare worker draws the blood andabout ml of blood is injected into each blood culturebottle The type of bottles used will vary based onwhether the physician is looking for bacteria aerobes oranaerobes yeast mold or viruses Aftercare Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture site or the person may feel dizzy or faint Pressure

are most commonly unpaid volunteers butthey may also be paid by commercial enterprises Blood GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Blood donation and registryGEM to B PM Page registry refers to the collection and sharing of data about donated blood and ineligible donors Purpose The purpose of the blood collection and distribution system is to help ensure an adequate supply of blood foraccident victims people needing surgery and people suffering from certain diseases as well as for medical research Sometimes donors give blood specifically to benefit a particular person People preparing for elective surgerymay donate their own blood to be held and then returnedto them during surgery This is known as autologousblood donation Directed donor blood has been donatedby someone known to the intended recipient such as afamily member or friend Each year more than four million Americans receive blood transfusions involving more than million unitsof blood one unit equals milliliters or about onepint or an average of about units per day All ofthat blood must be collected tested prepared stored anddelivered to the appropriate sites Roughly eight millionpeople in the United States donate blood each year abouthalf of the total amount needed is provided by the regional blood centers of the American Red Cross Whole blood and the various blood components have many uses Red blood cells which carry oxygen are usedto treat anemia Platelets which play a role in controllingbleeding are commonly used in the treatment ofleukemia and other cancers Fresh frozen plasma is alsoused to control bleeding in people deficient in certainclotting factors Cryoprecipitated AHF made from freshfrozen plasma contains a few specific clotting factors Precautions To ensure the safety of the blood supply a multi tiered process of donor screening and deferral isemployed This involves donor education taking adetailed health history of each prospective donor andgiving potential donors a simple physical examination which includes taking a few drops of blood to test foranemia At any point in the process a potential donormay be deferred or judged ineligible to donate bloodThis deferral may be temporary or permanent dependingon the reason Potential donors are also encouraged toselfdefer or voluntarily decline to donate rather thanput future blood recipients at risk All donated blood is extensively tested before being used The first step is determining the blood type whichindicates who can receive the blood Receiving the wrongtype of blood can cause death Blood is also screened for any antibodies that could cause complications for recipients In addition blood is tested to screen out donors infected with the following diseases Hepatitis B surface antigen ADD hepatitis B core antibody hepatitis C virus antibody HIV and HIV antibody HIV p antigenHTLVI and HTLVII antibodies and syphilis Nucleic Acid Amplification testing is also performed and othertests may be done if a doctor requests them In order to detect the greatest possible number of infections these screening tests are extremely sensitiveFor this reason however donors sometimes receive falsepositive test results In these cases more specific confirmatory tests are performed to help rule out false positiveresults Blood found to be abnormal is discarded and allitems coming into direct contact with donors are usedonly once and then discarded Donors of infected bloodare entered into the Donor Deferral Register a confidential national data base used to prevent deferred peoplefrom donating blood In general blood donors must be at least years old some states allow younger people to donate bloodwith their parents consent must weigh at least pounds kg and must be in good health Many factors can temporarily or permanently dis qualify potential donors Most of them have to do withhaving engaged in behaviors that put them at risk ofinfection or having spent time in certain specified areasAmong these factors are having had a tattoo having hadsex with people in highrisk groups having had certaindiseases and having been raped Description There are eight different blood types in allfour ABO groups each of which may be either Rh positive orRh negative These types and their approximate distribution in the US population are as follows O O A A B B AB AB In an emergency anyone can safely receivetype O red blood cells and people with this blood type areknown as universal donors People with type AB bloodknown as universal recipients can receive any type ofred blood cells and can give plasma to all blood types Blood donations can be made in community blood centers at hospitals or in bloodmobiles which visitschools churches and workplaces The actual process ofdonating whole blood takes about minutes A

plasma generally takes one to twohours Apheresis may also be used to collect other bloodcomponents such as platelets and granulocytes Preparation Once whole blood has been collected it is sent to a lab for testing and processing Most donated blood is separatedinto its constituent components such as red blood cellsplatelets and cryoprecipitate This enables more than oneperson to benefit from the

analysis is a test which measures the amounts ofoxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood as well as theacidity pH of the blood Purpose An ABG analysis evaluates how effectively the lungs are delivering oxygen to the blood and how efficiently they are eliminating carbon dioxide from it Thetest also indicates how well the lungs and kidneys areinteracting to maintain normal blood pH acidbase balance Blood gas studies are usually done to assess respiratory disease and other conditions that may affect thelungs and to manage patients receiving oxygen therapyrespiratory therapy In addition the acidbase component of the test provides information on kidney function Description Blood gas analysis is performed on blood from an artery It measures the partial pressures of oxygen andcarbon dioxide in the blood as well as oxygen contentoxygen saturation bicarbonate content and blood pH Oxygen in the lungs is carried to the tissues through the bloodstream but only a small amount of this oxygencan actually dissolve in arterial blood How much dissolves depends on the partial pressure of the oxygen thepressure that the gas exerts on the walls of the arteriesTherefore testing the partial pressure of oxygen is actually measuring how much oxygen the lungs are delivering to the blood Carbon dioxide is released into theblood as a byproduct of cell metabolism The partialcarbon dioxide pressure indicates how well the lungs areeliminating this carbon dioxide The remainder of oxygen that is not dissolved in the blood combines with hemoglobin a proteiniron compound found in the red blood cells The oxygen contentmeasurement in an ABG analysis indicates how muchoxygen is combined with the hemoglobin A relatedvalue is the oxygen saturation which compares theamount of oxygen actually combined with hemoglobin tothe total amount of oxygen that the hemoglobin is capable of combining with Carbon dioxide dissolves more readily in the blood than oxygen does primarily forming bicarbonate andsmaller amounts of carbonic acid When present in normal amounts the ratio of carbonic acid to bicarbonatecreates an acidbase balance in the blood helping to keepthe pH at a level where the bodys cellular functions aremost efficient The lungs and kidneys both participate inmaintaining the carbonic acidbicarbonate balance Thelungs control the carbonic acid level and the kidneys regulate the bicarbonate If either organ is not functioningproperly an acidbase imbalance can result Determination of bicarbonate and pH levels then aids in diagnosing the cause of abnormal blood gas values The procedure The blood sample is obtained by arterial puncture usu ally in the wrist although it could be in the groin or arm orfrom an arterial line already in place If a puncture is needed the skin over the artery is cleaned with an antiseptic Atechnician then collects the blood with a small sterile needleattached to a disposable syringe The patient may feel abrief throbbing or cramping at the

tests that measure the amount of sugar glucose in a personsblood These tests are done either on an empty stomachor after consuming a meal or premeasured glucose drinkBlood sugar tests are done primarily to diagnose andevaluate a person with diabetes mellitus Purpose The body uses sugar also called glucose to supply the energy it needs to function People get sugar fromtheir diet and from their body tissues Insulin is made bythe pancreas and affects the outer membrane of cellsmaking it easy for glucose to move from the blood intothe cells When insulin is active blood glucose levels fallSugar from body tissues is stored in the form of glycogenWhen glycogen is active blood glucose levels rise After a meal blood glucose levels rise sharply The pancreas responds by releasing enough insulin to takecare of all the newly added sugar found in the body Theinsulin moves the sugar out of the blood and into thecells Only then does the blood sugar start to level off and GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Blood sugar testsGEM to B PM Page begin to fall A person with diabetes mellitus either does not make enough insulin or makes insulin that does notwork properly The result is blood sugar that remainshigh a condition called hyperglycemia Diabetes must be diagnosed as early as possible If left untreated it can damage or cause failure of the eyeskidneys nerves heart blood vessels and other bodyorgans Hypoglycemia or low blood sugar may also be discovered through blood sugar testing Hypoglycemia iscaused by various hormone disorders and liver diseaseas well as by too much insulin Description There are a variety of ways to measure a persons blood sugar Whole blood glucose test Whole blood glucose testing can be performed by a person in his or her home and kits are available for thispurpose The person pricks his or her finger a fingerstick with a sterile sharp blade from the kit A singledrop of blood is placed on a strip in a portable instrumentcalled a glucometer The glucometer quickly determinesthe blood sugar and shows the results on a small screenin usually a few seconds Fasting plasma glucose test The fasting plasma glucose test is done on an empty stomach For the eight hours before the test the personmust fast nothing to eat or drink except water The persons blood is drawn from a vein by a healthcare workerThe blood sample is collected into a tube containing ananticoagulant Anticoagulants stop the blood from clotting In the laboratory the tube of blood spins at highspeed within a machine called a centrifuge The bloodcells sink to the bottom and the liquid stays on the topThis strawcolored liquid on the top is the plasma Tomeasure the glucose a persons plasma is combined withother substances From the resulting reaction the amountof glucose in the plasma is determined Oral glucose tolerance test The oral glucose tolerance test is done to see how well the body handles a standard amount of glucose Thistest measures the amount of glucose in a persons plasmabefore and two hours after drinking a large premeasuredbeverage containing glucose The person must eat a consistent diet containing at least oz g of carbohydrates each day for three days before this test For eighthours before the test the person must fast A healthcareprovider draws the first sample of blood at the end of thefast to determine the glucose level at the start of the test The healthcare provider then gives the person a beveragecontaining oz g of glucose Two hours later thepersons blood is drawn again These blood samples arecentrifuged and processed in the laboratory A doctor canthen compare the before and after glucose levels to seehow well the body processed the sugar Twohour postprandial blood glucose test The twohour postprandial blood glucose test mea sures the amount of glucose in plasma after a person eatsa specific meal containing a certain amount of sugarAlthough the meal follows a predetermined menu it isdifficult to control many factors associated with this testing method Blood sugar tests can be used in a variety of situa tions including Testing people suspected for diabetes The American Diabetic Association ADA recommends that either afasting plasma glucose test or an oral glucose tolerancetest be used to diagnose diabetes If the person alreadyhas symptoms of diabetes a blood glucose test withoutfasting called a casual plasma glucose test may bedone If the test result is abnormal it must be confirmedwith another test performed on another day The twotests can be different or they can be the same but theymust be done on different days If the second test is alsoabnormal the person has diabetes A twohour postprandial test is not recommended by the ADA as a testto use for the diagnosis of diabetes A doctor may orderthis test and follow it with the oral glucose tolerancetest or the fasting plasma glucose test if the results areabnormal Testing pregnant women Diabetes that occurs during pregnancy gestational diabetes is dangerous for both the mother and the baby Women who may be atrisk are screened when they are weeks pregnantA woman is considered at risk if she is older than years is not at her normal body weight has a parent orsibling with diabetes or if she is in an ethnic group thathas a high rate of diabetes Hispanics Native Americans Asians African Americans The blood sugar testto screen for gestational diabetes is a variation of theoral glucose tolerance test Fasting is not required Ifthe result is abnormal a more complete test is done onanother day Testing healthy people Healthy people without symp toms of diabetes should be screened for diabetes whenthey are years old and again every three years Eitherthe fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance testis used for screening People in high risk groups shouldbe tested before the age of and tested more frequently GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Blood sugar testsGEM to B PM Page Testing of people already diagnosed with diabetes The ADA recommends that a person with diabetes keep theamount of glucose in the blood at a normal level as muchas possible This can be done by the diabetic person testing his or her own blood at home one or more times a day Preparation Each blood sugar test that uses plasma requires a mL blood sample A healthcare worker ties a tight bandtourniquet on the persons upper arm locates a vein inthe inner elbow region and inserts a needle into thatvein Vacuum action draws the blood through the needleinto an attached tube Collection of the sample takes onlya few minutes When fasting is required the person should have nothing to eat or drink except water for eight hoursbefore the test and until the test or series of tests is completed The person should not smoke before or during thetesting period because this can temporarily increase theamount of glucose in the blood Other factors that cancause inaccurate results are a change in diet before thetest illness or surgery two weeks before the test certaindrugs and extended bed rest The doctor may tell a person on insulin or taking pills for diabetes to stop themedication until after the test Aftercare After the test or series of tests is completed and with the approval of his or her doctor the person shouldeat drink and take any medications that were stoppedfor the test The patient may feel discomfort when blood is drawn from a vein Bruising may occur at the puncture site orthe person may feel dizzy or faint Pressure to the puncture site until the bleeding stops will reduce bruisingWarm packs to the puncture site will relieve discomfort Risks If the person experiences any weakness fainting sweating or any other unusual reaction while fasting orduring the test he or she should immediately tell the person giving the test Normal results Normal results are fasting plasma glucose test less than mgdL oral glucose tolerance test hours less than mgdL For the diabetic person the ADA recommends an ongo ing blood sugar goal of less than or equal to

test called crossmatching is done after the blood is typed to find blood from a donor that the persons body will accept Purpose Blood typing and crossmatching are most common ly done to make certain that a person who needs a transfusion will receive blood that matches is compatiblewith his own People must receive blood of the sameblood type otherwise a serious even fatal transfusionreaction can occur Parents who are expecting a baby have their blood typed to diagnose and prevent hemolytic disease of thenewborn HDN a type of anemia also known as ery throblastosis fetalis Babies who have a blood type dif ferent from their mothers are at risk for developing thisdisease The disease is serious with certain blood typedifferences but is milder with others A child inherits factors or genes from each parent that determine his blood type This fact makes blood typing useful in paternity testing To determine whether ornot the alleged father could be the true father the bloodtypes of the child mother and alleged father are compared Legal investigations may require typing of blood or other body fluids such as semen or saliva to identifypersons involved in crimes or other legal matters Description Blood typing and crossmatching tests are performed in a blood bank laboratory by technologists trained inblood bank and transfusion services The tests are doneon blood after it has separated into cells and serumserum is the yellow liquid left after the blood clotsCosts for both tests are covered by insurance when thetests are determined to be medically necessary Blood bank laboratories are usually located in facili ties such as those operated by the American Red Crossthat collect process and supply blood that is donated aswell as in facilities such as most hospitals that prepareblood for transfusion These laboratories are regulated bythe United States Food and Drug Administration FDAand are often inspected and accredited by a professionalassociation such as the American Association of BloodBanks AABB Blood typing and crossmatching tests are based on the reaction between antigens and antibodies An antigencan be anything that causes the body to launch an attackknown as an immune response against it The attackbegins when the body builds a special protein called anantibody that is uniquely designed to attack and makeineffective neutralize the specific antigen that causedthe attack A persons body normally doesnt make antibodies against its own antigens only against antigensthat are foreign to it A persons body contains many antigens The anti gens found on the surface of red blood cells are important because they determine a persons blood type Whenred blood cells having a certain blood type antigen aremixed with serum containing antibodies against that antigen the antibodies attack and stick to the antigen In atest tube this reaction is observed as the formation ofclumps of cells clumping When blood is typed a persons cells and serum are mixed in a test tube with commerciallyprepared serumand cells Clumping tells which antigens or antibodiesare present and reveals the persons blood type Whenblood is crossmatched patient serum is mixed with cellsfrom donated blood that might be used for transfusionClumping or lack of clumping in the test tube tellswhether or not the blood is compatible Although there are over known red blood cell antigens organized into blood group systems routineblood typing and crossmatching is usually concernedwith only two systems the ABO and Rh blood groupsystems Blood typing ABO BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM In Karl Land steiner an Austrian pathologist randomly combined theserum and red blood cells of his colleagues From thereactions he observed in test tubes he discovered theABO blood group system This discovery earned him the Nobel Prize in Medicine A persons ABO blood typeA B AB or Ois based on the presence or absence of the A and B antigenson his red blood cells The A blood type has only the Aantigen and the B blood type has only the B antigen TheAB blood type has both A and B antigens and the Oblood type has neither A nor B antigen By the time a person is six months old he naturally will have developed antibodies against the antigens hisred blood cells lack That is a person with A blood typewill have antiB antibodies and a person with B blood GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Blood typing and crossmatchingGEM to B PM Page type will have antiA antibodies A person with AB blood type will have neither antibody but a person with Oblood type will have both antiA and antiB antibodiesAlthough the distribution of each of the four ABO bloodtypes varies between racial groups O is the most common and AB is the least common ABO typing is the first test done on blood when it is tested for transfusion A person must receive ABOmatched blood ABO incompatibilities are the majorcause of fatal transfusion reactions ABO antigens arealso found on most body organs so ABO compatibility isalso important for organ transplants An ABO incompatibility between a pregnant woman and her baby is a minor cause of HDN and usually causesno problem for the baby The structure of ABO antibodies makes it unlikely they will cross the placenta to attackthe babys red blood cells Paternity testing compares the ABO blood types of the child mother and alleged father The alleged fathercant be the true father if the childs blood type requires agene that neither he nor the mother have For example achild with blood type B whose mother has blood type Orequires a father with either AB or B blood type a man with blood type O cannot be the true father In some people ABO antigens can be found in body fluids other than blood such as saliva and semen ABOtyping of these fluids provides clues in legal investigations RH BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM The Rh or Rhesus system was first detected in by Landsteiner andWiener when they injected blood from rhesus monkeysinto guinea pigs and rabbits More than antigens havesince been discovered belonging to this system makingit the most complex red blood cell antigen system In routine blood typing and crossmatching tests only one of these antigens the D antigen also knownas the Rh factor or Rh oD is tested for If the D antigen is present that person is Rhpositive if the D antigen isabsent that person is Rhnegative Other important antigens in the Rh system are C c E and e These antigens are not usually tested for in routine blood typing tests However testing for the presenceof these antigens is useful in paternity testing and whena technologist tries to

GroupGEM to B PM Page or find matching blood for a person with antibodies to one or more of these antigens Unlike the ABO system antibodies to Rh antigens dont develop naturally They develop only as an immuneresponse after a transfusion or during pregnancy The incidence of the Rh blood types varies between racial groups but not as widely as the ABO blood types of whites and of blacks are Rhpositive of whites and of blacks are Rhnegative In transfusions the Rh system is next in importance after the ABO system Most Rhnegative people whoreceive Rhpositive blood will develop antiD antibodiesA later transfusion of Rhpositive blood could result in asevere or fatal transfusion reaction Rh incompatibility is the most common and severe cause of HDN This incompatibility can happen when anRhnegative woman and an Rhpositive man produce anRhpositive baby Cells from the baby can cross the placenta and enter the mothers bloodstream causing themother to make antiD antibodies Unlike ABO antibodies the structure of antiD antibodies makes it likely thatthey will cross the placenta and enter the babys bloodstream There they can destroy the babys red bloodcells causing severe or fatal anemia The first step in preventing HDN is to find out the Rh types of the expectant parents If the mother is Rhnegativeand the father is Rhpositive the baby is at risk for developing HDN The next step is to test the mothers serum tomake sure she doesnt already have antiD antibodies fromKEY TERMS ABO blood type Blood type based on the pres ence or absence of the A and B antigens on the

to blood typing Finally the Rhnegative mother isgiven an injection of Rh Immunoglobulin RhIg at weeks of gestation and again after delivery if the baby isRh positive The RhIg attaches to any Rhpositive cellsfrom the baby in the mothers bloodstream preventingthem from triggering antiD antibody production in themother An Rhnegative woman should also receive RhIgfollowing a miscarriage abortion or ectopic pregnancy OTHER BLOOD GROUP SYSTEMS Several other blood group systems may be involved in HDN and transfusion reactions although they are much less frequentthan ABO and Rh They are the Duffy Kell Kidd MNSand P systems Tests for antigens from these systems arenot included in routine blood typing but they are commonly used in paternity testing Like Rh antibodies antibodies in these systems do not develop naturally but as an immune response aftertransfusion or during pregnancy An antibody screeningtest is done before a crossmatch to check for unexpectedantibodies to antigens in these systems A persons serumis mixed in a test tube with commerciallyprepared cellscontaining antigens from these systems If clumpingoccurs the antibody is identified Crossmatching Crossmatching is the final step in pretransfusion testing It is commonly referred to as compatibility testing or Type and Cross GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Blood typing and crossmatchingGEM to B PM Page Before blood from a donor and the recipient are crossmatched both are ABO and Rh typed In additionantibody screening is done to look for antibodies to certain Rh Duffy MNS Kell Kidd and P system antigensIf an antibody to one of these antigens is found onlyblood without that antigen will be compatible in a crossmatch This sequence must be repeated before eachtransfusion a person receives To begin the crossmatch blood from a donor with the same ABO and Rh type as the rcipient is selected Ina test tube serum from the patient is mixed with redblood cells from the donor If clumping occurs the bloodis not compatible if clumping does not occur the bloodis compatible If an unexpected antibody is found ineither the patient or the donor the blood bank does further testing to make sure the blood is compatible In an emergency when there is not enough time for blood typing and crossmatching O red blood cells maybe given preferably Rhnegative O blood type is calledthe universal donor because it has no ABO antigens for apatients antibodies to attack In contrast AB blood typeis called the universal recipient because it has no ABOantibodies to attack the antigens on transfused red bloodcells If there is time for blood typing red blood cells ofthe recipient type type specific cells are given In eithercase the crossmatch is continued even though the transfusion has begun Preparation To collect the mL blood needed for these tests a healthcare worker ties a tourniquet above the patientselbow locates a vein in the inner elbow region andinserts a needle into that vein Vacuum action draws theblood through the needle into an attached tube Collection of the sample takes only a few minutes Blood typing and crossmatching must be done three days or less before a transfusion A person doesnt need tochange diet medications or activities before these testsHe should tell his healthcare provider if during the lastthree months he has received a blood transfusion or aplasma substitute or has had a radiology procedure usingintravenous contrast media These can give false clumping reactions in both typing and crossmatching tests Aftercare The possible side effects of any blood collection are discomfort or bruising at the site where the needle punctured the skin as well as dizziness or fainting Bruising is reduced if pressure is applied with a finger to the puncture site until the bleeding stops Discomfort is treatedwith warm packs to the puncture siteRisks There are no risks from the blood collection or test procedures Blood transfusions always have the risk of anunexpected transfusion reaction A nurse watches a patientfor signs of a reaction during the entire transfusion Normal results There is no normal blood type The desired result of a crossmatch is that compatible donor blood is found Compatibility testing procedures are designed to provide thesafest blood product possible for the recipient but a compatible crossmatch is no guarantee that an unexpectedadverse reaction will not appear during the transfusion Abnormal results Except in an emergency a person cannot receive a transfusion without a compatible crossmatch result Resources BOOKS

surrounding skin that form pustules smallblisterlike swellings containing pus around the follicleBoils are sometimes called furuncles A carbuncle isformed when several furuncles merge to form a singledeep abscess with several heads or drainage points Description Boils and carbuncles are firm reddish swellings about in mm across that are slightly raised abovethe skin surface They are sore to the touch A boil usuallyhas a visible central core of pus a carbuncle is larger andhas several visible heads Boils occur most commonly onthe face back of the neck buttocks upper legs and groinarea armpits and upper torso Carbuncles are less commonthan single boils they are most likely to form at the back ofthe neck Males are more likely to develop carbuncles Boils and carbuncles are common problems in the general population particularly among adolescents andadults People who are more likely to develop these skininfections include those with diabetes especially when treated by injected insulin alcoholism or drug abuse poor personal hygiene crowded living arrangements jobs or hobbies that expose them to greasy or oily sub stances especially petroleum products allergies or immune system disorders including HIV infection family members with recurrent skin infections Causes and symptoms Boils and carbuncles are caused by Staphylococcus aureus a bacterium that causes an infection in an oil gland or hair follicle Although the surface of human skinis usually resistant to bacterial infection S aureus can enter through a break in the skin surfaceincludingbreaks caused by needle punctures for insulin or druginjections Hair follicles that are blocked by greasycreams petroleum jelly or similar products are morevulnerable to infection Bacterial skin infections can bespread by shared cosmetics or washcloths close humancontact or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle As the infection develops an area of inflamed tissue gradually forms a pusfilled swelling or pimple that ispainful to touch As the boil matures it forms a yellowishhead or point It may either continue to swell until thepoint bursts open and allows the pus to drain or it maybe gradually reabsorbed into the skin It takes betweenone and two weeks for a boil to heal completely after itcomes to a head and discharges pus The bacteria thatcause the boil can spread into other areas of the skin oreven into the bloodstream if the skin around the boil isinjured by squeezing If the infection spreads the patientwill usually develop chills and fever swollen lymph nodes lymphadenitis and red lines in the skin running outward from the boil Furunculosis is a word that is sometimes used to refer to recurrent boils Many patients have repeatedepisodes of furunculosis that are difficult to treat becausetheir nasal passages carry colonies of S aureus These bacterial colonies make it easy for the patients skin to bereinfected They are most likely to develop in patientswith diabetes HIV infection or other immune systemdisorders Carbuncles are formed when the bacteria infect sev eral hair follicles that are close together Carbunculosis isa word that is sometimes used to refer to the development of carbuncles The abscesses spread until theymerge with each other to form a single large area ofinfected skin with several pusfilled heads Patients withcarbuncles may also have a lowgrade fever or feel generally unwell Diagnosis The diagnosis of boils and carbuncles is usually made by the patients primary care doctor on the basis ofvisual examination of the skin In some cases involvingrecurrent boils on the face the doctor may need to consider acne as a possible diagnosis but for the most part GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BoilsGEM to B PM Page boils and carbuncles are not difficult to distinguish from other skin disorders S aureus can easily be cultured in the laboratory if the doctor needs to rule out inclusion cysts or deep fungal infections that gardeners sometimes get The doctorcan make a culture from pus taken from the boil or carbuncle to confirm the diagnosis of a staphylococcalinfection He or she can also culture the patients nasaldischarge to test for the presence of a S aureus colony Treatment Patient and family education Patient education is an important part of the treatment of boils and carbuncles Patients need to be warned againstpicking at or squeezing boils because of the danger ofspreading the infection into other parts of the skin orbloodstream It is especially important to avoid squeezingboils around the mouth or nose because infections in theseareas can be carried to the brain Patients should also beadvised about keeping the skin clean washing their handscarefully before and after touching the boil or carbuncleavoiding the use of greasy cosmetics or creams and keeping their towels and washcloths separate from those ofother family members Some doctors may recommend anantiseptic soap or gel for washing the infected areas If the patient has had several episodes of furunculo sis the doctor may examine family members or closecontacts to see if they are carriers of S aureus In many cases they also need treatment for boils or carbunclesSkin infections and reinfections involving small groupsor clusters of people are being reported more frequentlyin the United States Medications Boils are usually treated with application of antibiot ic creamsusually clindamycin or polymyxinfollowing the application of hot compresses The compresseshelp the infection to come to a head and drain Carbuncles and furunculosis are usually treated with oral antibiotics as well as antibiotic creams or oint ments The specific medications that are given are usually dicloxacillin Dynapen or cephalexin Keflex Erythromycin may be given to patients who are allergic topenicillin The usual course of oral antibiotics is days however patients with recurrent furunculosis maybe given oral antibiotics for longer periods Furunculosisis treated with a combination of dicloxacillin andrifampin Rifadin Patients with bacterial colonies in their nasal pas sages are often given mupirocin Bactroban to applydirectly to the lining of the noseSurgical treatment Boils and carbuncles that are very large or that are not draining may be opened with a sterile needle or surgical knife to allow the pus to drain The doctor will usually give the patient a local anesthetic if a knife is usedsurgical treatment of boils is painful and usually leavesnoticeable scars Alternative treatment Naturopathic therapy Naturopathic practitioners usually recommend changes in the patients diet as well as applying herbalpoultices to the infected area The addition of zinc supplements and vitamin A to the diet is reported to beeffective in treating boils The application of a paste orpoultice containing goldenseal Hydrastis canadensis root is recommended by naturopaths on the groundsthat goldenseal helps to kill bacteria and reduceinflammation Homeopathy Homeopaths maintain that taking the proper homeo pathic medication in the first stages of a boil or carbunclewill bring about early resolution of the infection and prevent pus formation The most likely choices are Bel ladonna or Hepar sulphuris If the boil has already formed Mercurius vivus or Silica may be recommended to bring the pus to a head Western herbal therapies A variety of herbal remedies can be applied topi cally to boils to fight infection These include essentialoils of bergamot Citrus bergamia chamomile Matri GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Boils A closeup view of a

menopause as well as older men They also are used pre scribed for Pagets disease a painful condition that weakens and deforms bones and they are used to control calcium levels in the blood Bone is living tissue Like other tissue bone is con stantly being broken down and replaced with new material Normally there is a balance between the breakdownof old bone and its replacement with new bone Butwhen something goes wrong with the process bone disorders may result Osteoporosis is a particular concern for women after menopause as well as for older men In osteoporosis the inside of the bones become porous and thinOver time this condition weakens the bones and makesthem more likely to break Osteoporosis is four timesmore common in women than in men This is becausewomen have less bone mass than men tend to livelonger and take in less calcium and need the femalehormone estrogen to keep their bones strong If menlive long enough they are also at risk of getting osteoporosis later in life Once total bone mass has peakedaround age all adults start to lose it In women therate of bone loss speeds up during menopause when estrogen levels fall Bone loss may also occur if bothovaries are removed by surgery Ovaries make estrogenHormone replacement therapy is one approach to preventing osteoporosis However not all people canuse hormone replacement therapy Bone disorder drugsare a good alternative for people who already haveosteoporosis or who are at risk of developing it Riskfactors include lack of regular exercise early menopause being underweight and a strong familyhistory of osteoporosis Description Bone disorder drugs are available only with a physicians prescription and come in tablet nasalspray and injectable forms Commonly used bone disorder drugs are alendronate Fosamax calcitoninMiacalcin Calcimar and raloxifene Evista Raloxifene belongs to a group of drugs known as selectiveestrogen receptor modulators SERMs which act likeestrogen in some parts of the body but not in othersThis makes the drugs less likely to cause some of theharmful effects that estrogen may cause Unlike estrogen raloxifene does not increase the risk of breast cancer In fact research suggests that raloxifene may even reduce that riskRecommended dosage Alendronate FOR OSTEOPOROSIS The usual dose is mg once a day Treatment usually continues over many years FOR PAGETS DISEASE The usual dose is mg once a day for six months This medicine works only when it is taken with a full glass of water first thing in the morning at least minutes before eating or drinking anything or taking anyother medicine Do not lie down for at least minutesafter taking it because the drug can irritate the esophagusthe tube that delivers food form the mouth to the stomach Calcitonin NASAL SPRAY The usual dose is one spray into the nose once a day Alternate nostrils spraying the rightnostril one day the left nostril the next day and so on INJECTABLE The recommended dosage depends on the condition for which the medicine is prescribed andmay be different for different people Check with thephysician who prescribed the medicine or the pharmacistwho filled the prescription for the proper dosage Raloxifene The usual dose is one mg tablet daily Precautions Aldendronate People with low levels of calcium in their blood should not take this medicine It also is not recommendedfor women on hormone replacement therapy or for anyonewith kidney problems Before using alendronate anyonewho has digestive or swallowing problems should makesure that his or her physician knows about the condition Calcitonin Calcitonin nasal spray may cause irritation or small sores in the nose Check with a physician if this becomesvery uncomfortable or if there is bleeding from the nose The injectable form of calcitonin has caused serious allergic reactions in a few people The nasal spray is notknown to cause such reactions but the possibility existsBefore starting treatment with calcitonin the physicianwho prescribes the drug may order an allergy test tomake sure there will not be a problem Raloxifene A rare but serious side effect of raloxifene is an increased risk of blood clots that form in the veins and GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bone disorder drugsGEM to B PM Page may break away and travel to the lungs This is about as likely in women who take raloxifene as it is in womenwho take estrogen Because of this possible problemwomen with a history of blood clots in their veins shouldnot take raloxifene Women who have had breast cancer or cancer of the uterus should check with their physicians about whetherthey can safely use raloxifene General precautions for bone disorder drugs To keep bones strong the body needs calcium and vitamin D Dairy products and fish such as salmon sardines and tuna are good sources of both calcium and vitamin D People who are taking bone disorder drugs forosteoporosis and who do not get enough of these nutrients in their diets should check with their physicians about taking supplements Other important bonesavingsteps are avoiding smoking and alcohol and getting enough of the kind of exercise that puts weight on thebones such as walking or lifting weights People who are taking these drugs because they have too much calcium in their blood may need to limit the amount of calcium in their diets Too much calcium may prevent the medicine from working properly Discuss the properdiet with the physician who prescribed the drug and do notmake any diet changes without the physicians approval Anyone who has had unusual reactions to bone dis order drugs in the past should let his or her physicianknow before taking the drugs again The physician alsoshould be told about any allergies to foods dyes preser vatives or other substances Women who are pregnant or who may become preg nant and women who are breastfeeding should checkwith their physicians before using this alendronate or calcitonin Raloxifene should not be used by women whoare pregnant or who may become pregnant In laboratorystudies of rats raloxifene caused birth defects Side effects Aldendronate Common side effects include constipation diar rhea indigestion nausea pain in

a replacement material is placed into spacesbetween or around broken bone fractures or holes in bone defects to aid in healing Purpose Bone grafting is used to repair bone fractures that are extremely complex pose a significant risk to thepatient or fail to heal properly Bone graft is also used tohelp fusion between vertebrae correct deformities orprovide structural support for fractures of the spine Inaddition to fracture repair bone graft is used to repair defects in bone caused by birth defects traumatic injury or surgery for bone cancer Description Bone is composed of a matrix mainly made up of a protein called collagen It is strengthened by deposits ofcalcium and phosphate salts called hydroxyapatiteWithin and around this matrix are located the cells of thebones which are of four types Osteoblasts produce thebone matrix Osteocytes are mature osteoblasts and serveto maintain the bone Osteoclasts break down andremove bone tissue Bone lining cells cover bone surfaces Together these four types of cells are responsiblefor building the bone matrix maintaining it and remodeling the bone as needed There are three ways in which a bone graft can help repair a defect The first is called osteogenesis the formation of new bone by the cells contained within thegraft The second is osteoinduction a chemical processin which molecules contained within the graft bonemorphogenetic proteins convert the patients cells intocells that are capable of forming bone The third is osteoconduction a physical effect by which the matrix of thegraft forms a scaffold on which cells in the recipient areable to form new bone New bone for grafting can be obtained from other bones in the patients own body eg hip bones or ribscalled autograft or from bone taken from other peoplethat is frozen and stored in tissue banks called allograftA variety of natural and synthetic replacement materialsare also used instead of bone including collagen theprotein substance of the white fibers of the skin boneand connective tissues polymers such as silicone andsome acrylics hydroxyapatite calcium sulfate andceramics A new material called resorbable polymericgrafts is also being studied These resorbable grafts provide a structure for new bone to grow on the grafts thenslowly dissolve leaving only the new bone behind To place the graft the surgeon makes an incision in the skin over the bone defect and shapes the bone graft orreplacement material to fit into the defect After the graftis placed into the defect it is held in place with pinsplates or screws The incision is closed with stitches anda splint or cast is used to prevent movement of the boneswhile healing The costs associated with a bone graft vary These costs include the surgeons fee variable anesthesiologists fees averaging to per hour hospitalcharges averaging to per day more forintensive care or private rooms medication charges to and additional charges including anassisting surgeon treatment of complications diagnosticprocedures eg blood work or x rays medical supplies and equipment use The cost for the graft itself canrange from to GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bone graftingGEM to B PM Page This procedure is covered by many thirdparty insur ers insurance coverage should be explored for each individual case Aftercare The time required for convalescence for fractures or spinal fusion may vary from one to days and vigorous exercise may be limited for up to three months Most bone grafts are successful in helping the bone defect to heal The extent of recovery will depend on thesize of the defect and the condition of the bone surrounding the graft at the time of surgery Severe defectsmay take some time to heal and may require furtherattention after the initial graft In one study of over patients who received very large allografts aftersurgery for bone cancer researchers found that approximately of the patients were able to return to workor normal physical activities without using crutchesHowever about of these patients required a secondoperation because the first did not heal properly Lesssevere bone defects though should heal completelywithout serious complications Risks The risks for any surgical procedure requiring anes thesia include reactions to the medications and breathingproblems The risks for any surgical procedure includebleeding and infection The drawbacks of autografts include the additional surgical and anesthesia time typically minutes perprocedure to obtain or harvest the bone for graftingadded costs of the additional surgery pain and infection that might occur at the site from which the graft is takenand the relatively small amount of bone that is availablefor grafting The drawbacks of allografts include variability between lots since the bone is harvested from a varietyof donors the bone may take longer to incorporate withthe host bone than an autograft would the graft may beless effective than an autograft and the possibility oftransferring diseases to the patient Other complicationsmay result from the immune response mounted by thepatients immune system against the grafted bone tissueWith the use antirejection agents

Beverly Road Suite A McLean V A Lisa Christenson PhD Bone growth stimulation Definition Bone growth stimulation is the technique of promot ing bone growth in difficult to heal fractures by apply ing a low electrical current or ultrasound to the fracture Purpose Bone growth stimulation is done when satisfactory healing is not occurring naturally or when the pace ofhealing is too slow This condition is called fracturenonunion and it occurs more frequently among adultsthan children in people with severe or complex fracturesand in people who smoke The theory behind applying an electric current to fractures to stimulate healing is based on the fact thatthe concave side of the bone becomes negativelycharged and the convex side is positively charged It isbelieved that artificially encouraging this charging withan electric current will speed healing In the Foodand Drug Administration FDA also approved theapplication of low intensity ultrasound pulses as a treatment for fracture nonunion Ultrasound and electromagnetic stimulation are expensive and are used only when healing problems existfor a substantial length of time Each method must beused for at least three to six months to be effective Precautions Bone growth stimulation cannot be used if the gap between the ends of the fracture is too large Description Electric stimulation can be applied either from the inside of the body invasively or from the outside thebody noninvasively Ultrasound is a noninvasive procedure The type of stimulation selected depends on thedoctors preference the type and location of the fractureand the patients motivation to comply with the treatment schedule Treatment can take anywhere from threeto six monthsInvasive stimulators Invasive electric stimulators are either fully or partial ly implantable The advantage of these devices is that theyapply a direct electric current to the fracture hours aday The fully implantable stimulator requires little dailyattention from the patient Patients using a semiimplantedstimulator must regulate their own treatment schedule andhave to care for the external power pack The disadvantageof implantable and semiimplantable stimulators is thattheir implantation is a surgical procedure Fully implantable direct current stimulators are installed in a hospital under general or regional anesthesiaBoth the stimulator and the power source are implantedThe surgeon makes an incision and places a spiral shapedcathode inside the bone A wire leads to the power sourceand a small anode The power source is a battery pack thatis implanted in the nearby muscle The body transmitselectrical current to close the circuit The incision is thenclosed Once in place the device provides continuousdirect electric current for bone growth stimulation Partially implanted stimulators use cathode pins that are implanted at the edge of each bone that is fracturedWires lead to the surface of the skin where a powersource and the anode are located Wires complete the circuit The external portion of the device is held in place bya cast This source of stimulation also runs continuously Noninvasive stimulators In the noninvasive stimulator external electromag netic coils are placed on either side of the fracture andare held in place by a strap or cuff Locating the coilscorrectly is important and their location relative to thefracture is usually confirmed by x rays The coils produce a pulsating electromagnetic field It is up to the patient to maintain the prescribed treatmentschedule Effective treatment requires stimulation anywhere from three to ten hours each day in periods of noless than one hour Ultrasound stimulation is the most recent treatment for stimulating bone growth A device that generates lowintensity pulses of sound is applied to the skin over thefracture The advantage of this technique is that it is noninvasive and the period of application of the sound pulsescan be as short as minutes each day The results ofthis treatment have been studied less than the effect ofelectromagnetic stimulation Preparation Bone growth stimulation is done only when healing has failed to occur for many months Before it is started GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bone growth stimulationGEM to B PM Page x rays are done of the fracture area If the device is to be implanted standard preoperative blood and urine testsare done The patient may meet with an anesthesiologistto discuss any conditions that might affect the administration of anesthesia Aftercare If a noninvasive pulsating electromagnetic field device is used the patient must not put any stress or weight on the fracture until it is healed which is a matterof months in most cases In all lower limb fracturesregardless of the stimulation method used the patient cannot bear weight on the limb with the fracture until healing is complete This limits the patients mobility formany months Patients have the responsibility for regularly making sure that the unit works and caring forexternal devices and the casts that hold them in place Risks Noninvasive devices have few risks associated with them The main risk associated with implantable devicesis the development of infection at the site of implantation Normal results Success in healing a fracture nonunion using bone growth stimulation depends on the type location andseverity of the fracture and

Description Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy should be per formed by a physician or nurse clinician Each procedure takes about to minutes and is usually performed on an outpatient basis but can be done in a hospital if necessary The skin covering the biopsy site is cleansed with an antiseptic and the patient may be given a mild sedativeA local anesthetic is administered The hematologist ornurse clinician performing the procedure will not beginuntil the anesthetic has numbed the area from which thespecimen is to be extracted In both adults and childrenaspiration and biopsy are most commonly performed onthe rear bone of the hip posterior iliac crest In adultssampling from the sternum breastbone is sometimesdone The latter location is technically easier but issomewhat more painful for the patient and presents therisk of heart injury On rare occasions a long bone of theleg tibia may be used as a sample site for an infant In a bone marrow aspiration a special needle is inserted beneath the skin and rotated until it penetratesthe cortex or outer covering of the bone At least half ateaspoon of marrow is withdrawn from the bone by a syringe attached to the needle The patient may experience discomfort when the needle is inserted or when themarrow is aspirated If more marrow is needed the needle is repositioned slightly a new syringe is attached anda second sample is taken The samples are transferredfrom the syringes to slides and vials then sent to a laboratory for analysis Bone marrow biopsy may be performed immediately before or after bone marrow aspiration The procedure utilizes a special largebore needle that is used to drill out acore of marrow In bone marrow biopsy the needle isinserted rotated from side to side withdrawn and reinserted at a different angle This

transplantation Definition The bone marrowthe spongelike tissue found in the center of certain bonescontains stem cells that arethe precursors of white blood cells red blood cells andplatelets These blood cells are vital for normal bodyfunctions such as oxygen transport defense againstinfection and disease and clotting Blood cells have alimited lifespan and are constantly being replaced therefore healthy stem cells are vital In association with certain diseases stem cells may produce too many too few or otherwise abnormal bloodcells Also medical treatments may destroy stem cells oralter blood cell production The resultant blood cellabnormalities can be life threatening Bone marrow transplantation involves extracting bone marrow containing normal stem cells from ahealthy donor and transferring it to a recipient whosebody cannot manufacture proper quantities of normalblood cells The goal of the transplant is to rebuild therecipients blood cells and immune system and hopefullycure the underlying ailment Purpose A persons red blood cells white blood cells and platelets may be destroyed or may be abnormal due todisease Also certain medical therapies particularlychemotherapy or radiation treatment may destroy a persons stem cells The consequence to a persons healthis severe Under normal circumstances red blood cellscarry oxygen throughout the body and remove carbondioxide from the bodys tissues White blood cells formthe cornerstone of the bodys immune system and defendit against infection Platelets limit bleeding by enablingthe blood to clot if a blood vessel is damaged A bone marrow transplant is used to rebuild the bodys capacity to produce these blood cells and bringtheir numbers to normal levels Illnesses that may betreated with a bone marrow transplant include both cancerous and noncancerous diseases Cancerous diseases may or may not specifically involve blood cells but cancer treatment can destroy the bodys ability to manufacture new blood cells Bone marrow transplantation may be used in conjunction withadditional treatments such as chemotherapy for varioustypes of leukemia Hodgkins disease lymphoma breast and ovarian cancer and other cancers Noncancerous diseases for which bone marrow transplantation can be atreatment option include aplastic anemia sickle cell disease thalassemia and severe immunodeficiency Precautions Bone marrow transplants are not for everyone Transplants are accompanied by a risk of infection transplant rejection by the recipients immune system andother complications The procedure has a lower successrate the greater the recipients age Complications areexacerbated for people whose health is already seriouslyimpaired as in latestage cancers Therefore a personsage or state of health may prohibit use of a bone marrowtransplant The typical cutoff age for a transplant rangesfrom to years however a persons general health isusually the more important factor Even in the absence of complications the transplant and associated treatments are hard on the recipient Bonemarrow transplants are debilitating A persons ability towithstand the rigors of the transplant is a key consideration in deciding to use this treatment Description Autologous and allogeneic transplants Two important requirements for a bone marrow transplant are the donor and the recipient Sometimesthe donor and the recipient may be the same person Thistype of transplant is called an autologous transplant It istypically used in cases in which a persons bone marrowis generally healthy but will be destroyed due to medicaltreatment for diseases such as breast cancer and Hodgkins disease Most bone marrow transplants areautologous If a persons bone marrow is unsuitable foran autologous transplant the bone marrow must bederived from another person in an allogeneic transplant Allogeneic transplants are more complicated because of proteins called human lymphocyte antigens GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bone marrow transplantationGEM to B PM Page HLA that are on the surface of bone marrow cells If the donor and the recipient have very dissimilar antigensthe recipients immune system regards the donors bonemarrow cells as invaders and launches a destructiveattack against them Such an attack negates any benefitsoffered by the transplant HLA matching There are only five major HLA classes or types designated HLAAB CD and class IIIbut muchvariation within the groupings For example HLAAfrom one individual may be similar to but not the sameas HLAA in another individual such a situation canrender a transplant from one to the other impossible HLA matching is more likely if the donor and recip ient are related particularly if they are siblings howeveran unrelated donor may be a potential match Only inrare cases is matching HLA types between two peoplenot an issue if the recipient has an identical twin Identical twins carry the same genes therefore the same antigens A bone marrow transplant between identical twinsis called a syngeneic transplant Peripheral blood stem cell transplants A relatively recent development in stem cell trans plantation is the use of peripheral blood cells instead ofstem cells from bone marrow Peripheral blood stem cellsPBSCs are obtained from circulating blood rather thanfrom bone marrow but the amount of stem cells found inthe peripheral blood is much smaller than the amount ofstem cells found in the bone marrow Peripheral bloodstem cells can be used in either autologous or allogeneictransplants The majority of PBSC transplants are autologous However recent clinical studies indicate thatPBSCs are being used more frequently than bone marrow for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation The advantages of PBSC transplants when compared to bone marrow transplants are in allogeneic transplantation haematopoietic and immune recovery are faster withPBSCs which reduces the potential for disease recurrence primarily graftversushostdisease In autologoustransplantation the use of PBSCs can result in fasterblood count recoveries Also some medical conditions exist in which the recipient cannot accept bone marrowstem cell transplants but can accept PBSC transplantsSome possible disadvantages to PBSC transplant versusbone marrow transplantation are so much more fluid volume is necessary to collect enough PBSCs that at thetime of infusing the new stem cells into the recipient thefluid can collect in the lungs or cause temporary kidneyproblems Also the time commitment for the donor for aPBSC transplant is considerable When the PBSCs arebeing collected several outpatient sessions are needed and each session lasts approximately twofour hours The transplant procedure BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION The bone mar row extraction or harvest is the same whether for an autologous or allogeneic transplant Harvesting is done undergeneral anesthesia ie the donor sleeps through the procedure and discomfort is usually minimal afterwards Bonemarrow is drawn from the iliac crest the part of the hipbone to either side of the lower back with a special needleand a syringe Several punctures are usually necessary tocollect the needed amount of bone marrow approximately quarts This amount is only a small percentage of the total bone marrow and is typically replaced within four weeks The donor remains at the hospital for hours and can resume normal activities within a few days If the bone marrow is meant for an autologous trans plant it is stored at to F to C untilit is needed Bone marrow for an allogeneic transplant issometimes treated to remove the donors T cells a typeof white blood cell or to remove ABO blood type antigens otherwise it is transplanted without modification GALE

radioactive substance is injected intravenously and the image ofits distribution in the skeletal system is analyzed to detectcertain diseases or conditions Purpose Bone scans are most frequently ordered to check whether a cancer that originated elsewhere has spread to the bones Cancers which begin in the breasts kidneyslungs prostate thyroid or urinary bladder are most likely to spread or metastasize to the bones If metastasesare found periodic bone scans may be ordered to see iftherapy is effective against a cancer Some cancers arise in bone These are called primary bone cancers When an abnormality is found on an x ray ofa bone a bone scan may be helpful in deciding if it is a primary bone cancer or a noncancerous benign conditionInfection in the bone osteomyelitis can be detected or confirmed by a bone scan often days or weeks beforean x ray would reveal it Bone scans are useful in diagnosing early arthritic changes and monitoring both theprogression of the disease and the effectiveness of treatment Unexplained pain may be evaluated with a bone scan because it can demonstrate fractures which are dif ficult to detect on x ray Bone scans can be used to see ifartificial joints have loosened or become infected Suspected child abuse may be evaluated with a bone scan due to its ability to see an overall pattern of repeatedtrauma Abnormalities caused by altered circulation tothe bone may be diagnosed with a bone scan Precautions Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not have this test A patient who is unable to remain stillfor an extended period of time may require sedation for a bone scan Description This test is performed in a radiology facility either in a hospital department or an outpatient xray centerThe patient usually sits or lies down while a radioactivesubstance is injected through a vein in the arm For abone scan the radionuclide used is specifically chosen toaccumulate in the bone The patient then waits from threeto four hours for the substance to collect within theskeletal system During this time he or she will beinstructed to drink several glasses of water Patients arefree to get up and move around as they desire during thiswaiting time and should urinate frequently Just beforethe scanning begins the patient should empty his or herbladder again This ensures that a lot of radioactive material is not concentrated in the urinary bladder whichcould obscure part of the pelvic bones During the scan the patient lies on his or her back on a table but may be repositioned to the stomach or sideduring the study It is important for the patient not tomove except when directed to by the technologist The radionuclide scanner sometimes called a gamma camera or scintillation camera is positionedagainst the body part to be examined Either the camerathe table or both may change position during the studyFor a total body bone scan the patient is scanned fromhead to foot over a period of minutes Patientsshould experience no discomfort from this examination A special kind of bone scan called a SPECT Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography scan may beadded to study a particular part of the body in moredetail Suspected diseases of the hips lower back or jaw GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bone nuclear medicine scanGEM to B PM Page are often evaluated using this study It usually takes an additional minutes The camera circles completelyaround the area in question or multiple cameras are usedto create a crosssectional image This helps pinpoint thelocation of the abnormality being evaluated Another variation is called a threephase or three stage bone scan The procedure is the same except thescanning takes place immediately after the radioactivesubstance is injected approximately minutes after

disease or injury to the bone such as broken bones tumors and other problems They can determine bone density texture erosionand changes in bone relationships Bone x rays also evaluate the joints for diseases such as osteoarthritis Precautions Precautions should be taken to protect patients from unnecessary exposure to radiation Patients should beshielded with lead aprons as much as possible Women

electrical current passes through anxray tube and produces a beam of ionizing radiation thatpasses through the bones being examined This producesa picture of the inside of the body on film The physicianreads the developed x ray on a wallmounted light box Digital x rays are a new type of x ray in which con ventional equipment is used to take the x ray but theimage is produced via computer In a digital x ray theimage is created on a reusable plate After being read bya laser reader the information is sent in digital form to astorage unit connected to a computer network fromwhich the radiologist reads the x ray An electronic reportcan then be sent to the patients physician Problems with bones that x rays can detect result from injury or from disease caused by a malfunction inthe patients bone chemistry Bone injuries especiallybroken bones fractures are common and can be accurately diagnosed by bone x rays X rays are especially helpful in diagnosing simple and incomplete

x rays are performed by a technician or radiol ogist and interpreted by a radiologist They are taken ina physicians office radiology unit outpatient clinic ordiagnostic clinic Bone x rays generally take less than minutes There is no pain or discomfort associated with the test but some people find it difficult to remain stillThe results are often available in minutes During the test the patient lies on a table The tech nician taking the x ray will check the patients positioning and place the xray machine over the part of the bodybeing examined After asking the patient to remainmotionless he or she steps out of the area and presses abutton to take the picture Preparation The patient is asked to remove clothing jewelry and any other metal objects from the area being x rayed Ifappropriate a lead shield will be placed over other bodyparts to minimize exposure to radiation Aftercare The patient can immediately resume normal activities Risks The human body contains some natural radiation and is also exposed to radiation in the environmentThere is a slight risk from exposure to radiation duringbone x rays however the amount of radiation is smalland the risk of harm is very low If reproductive organsare exposed to radiation genetic alterations may occurExcessive or repeated doses of radiation can causechanges in other types of body tissue No radiationremains in the body after the x ray Normal results Normal bones show no fractures dislocations or other abnormalities Abnormal results Results that indicate the presence of bone injury or disease differ in appearance according

the treatment of chronic muscle tension and migraine headaches Therelief is likely due to the decrease in localized musclespasms as no direct effect of Botox on the sensorynerves has been established Precautions Botulinum toxin is produced from the bacterium that causes food poisoning in humans High doses of the toxin can be fatal however doses administered therapeutically are so small that harmful effects are uncommon Description The number of potential applications for botulinum toxin extends to every muscle group The first therapeutic use of Botox was in the treatment of strabismus eyes are unable to direct towards the same object and sincethen it has been used to treat a variety of involuntarymuscle contractions or disorders Its cosmetic use is theresult of treatment for facial

three months and is the therapeutic agentof choice for most conditions Preparation The dosage of Botox must be monitored and adjust ed with multiple injections showing a lower incidence

Exposure to the botulinum toxin occurs mostlyfrom eating contaminated food or in infants from certain clostridia growing in the intestine Botulinum toxinblocks motor nerves ability to release acetylcholine theneurotransmitter that relays nerve signals to muscles andflaccid paralysis occurs As botulism progresses the muscles that control the airway and breathing fail Description Botulism occurs rarely but it incites concern because of its high fatality rate Clinical descriptions ofbotulism possibly reach as far back in history as ancientRome and Greece However the relationship betweencontaminated food and botulism wasnt defined until thelate s In the German physician JustiniusKerner deduced that a substance in spoiled sausageswhich he called wurstgift German for sausage poison caused botulism The toxins origin and identityremained elusive until Emile von Ermengem a Belgianprofessor isolated Clostridium botulinum in and identified it as the poison source Three types of botulism have been identified food borne wound and infant botulism The main differencebetween types hinges on the route of exposure to thetoxin In the United States there are approximately cases of botulism reported annually Foodborne botulism accounts for of all botulism cases and can betraced to eating contaminated homepreserved foodInfant botulism accounts for of all cases but therecovery rate is good about with proper treatment Though domestic food poisoning is a problem worldwide there has been a growing concern regardingthe use of botulism toxin in biological warfare and terror GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BotulismGEM to B PM Page ist acts The Iraqi government admitted in that it had loaded liters of botulinum toxin into SCUDmissiles during the Gulf War Luckily these special missiles were never used As of there were countries known to be developing biological weapons including the culture of botulism toxins Causes and symptoms Causes Toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botu linum is the main culprit in botulism Other members of the clostridium genus can produce botulinum toxin namely C argentinense C butyricum and C baratii b u t they are minor sources To grow these bacteria require alowacid oxygenfree environment that is warm F or C and moist Lacking these conditions the bacteria transform themselves into spores thatlike plant seeds can remain dormant for years Clostridiaand their spores exist all over the world especially in soiland aquatic sediments They do not threaten human oranimal health until the spores encounter an environmentthat favors growth The spores then germinate and thegrowing bacteria produce the deadly botulism toxin Scientists have discovered that clostridia can produce at least seven types of botulism toxin identified as A BC D E F and G Humans are usually affected by A B Eand very rarely F Domesticated animals such as dogs cattle and mink are affected by botulism C toxin which alsoaffects birds and has caused massive dieoffs in domesticbird flocks and wild waterfowl Botulism D toxin cancause illness in cattle and horses succumb to botulism AB and C toxin There have been no confirmed human oranimal botulism cases linked to the G toxin In humans botulinum toxin latches onto specific proteins in nerve endings and irreversibly destroysthem These proteins control the release of acetylcholine a neurotransmitter that stimulates musclecells With acetylcholine release blocked nerves arenot able to stimulate muscles Ironically botulinumtoxin has found a beneficial niche in the world of medicine due to this action Certain medical disorders arecharacterized by involuntary and uncontrollable muscle contractions Medical researchers have discoveredthat injecting a strictly controlled dose of botulinumtoxin into affected muscles inhibits excessive musclecontractions The muscle is partially paralyzed andnormal movement is retained Symptoms The three types of human botulism include the fol lowing symptoms Foodborne Food that has been improperly preserved or stored can harbor botulinum toxinproducing clostridiaBotulism symptoms typically appear within hoursof eating contaminated food with extremes of fourhours to eight days Initial symptoms include blurred ordouble vision and difficulty swallowing and speakingPossible gastrointestinal problems include constipation nausea and vomiting As botulism progresses the victim experiences weakness or paralysis starting with thehead muscles and progressing down the body Breathingbecomes increasingly difficult Without medical carerespiratory failure and death are very likely Infant Infant botulism was first described in Unlike adults infants younger than months are vulnerable to C botulinum colonizing the intestine Infants ingest spores in honey or simply by swallowing sporecontaining dust The spores germinate in the largeintestine and as the bacteria grow they produce botulinum toxin that is absorbed into the infants body Thefirst symptoms include constipation lethargy and poorfeeding As infant botulism progresses sucking andswallowing thus eating become difficult A nursingmother will often notice breast engorgement as the firstsign of her infants illness The baby suffers overallweakness and cannot control head movements Becauseof the flaccid paralysis of the muscles the baby appearsfloppy Breathing is impaired and death from respiratory failure is a very real danger Wound Confirmed cases of wound botulism have been linked to trauma such as severe crush injuries to theextremities surgery and illegal drug use Wound botulism occurs when clostridia colonize an infected woundand produce botulinum toxin The symptoms usuallyappear four to days after an injury occurs and aresimilar to foodborne botulism although gastrointestinal symptoms may be absent Diagnosis Diagnosis of botulism can be tricky because symp toms mimic those presented by other diseases Botulismmay be confused with GuillainBarre syndrome myas thenia gravis drug reactions stroke or nervous system infection intoxications eg carbon monoxide oratropine or shellfish poisoning Sepsis is the most com mon initial diagnosis for infant botulism Failure to thrive may also be suspected Some reports have linked infant botulism to of sudden infant death syn drome SIDS crib death cases Laboratory tests are used for

normal bowel movements in persons who suffer from constipation diarrhea incontinence or irregularity Healthy bowel activity is considered one or two movements of moderatesize every day Purpose Many people for many reasons have irregular bowel function In some cases the irregularity lasts beyond thecondition that caused it The bowels by themselves developbad habits that can be retrained with suitable exercises andeducation Normal bowel habits not only improve the quality of life they help prevent several common diseasesforexample diverticulitis and fecal impaction Gall stonesappendicitis colon cancer hiatal hernia diabetes and heart disease have also been related to the quality of bowelmovements and the foods that affect them One of the most common causes of constipation is the laxative habit Repeated artificial stimulation of thebowels destroys their natural emptying reflex so thatthey will no longer move without artificial stimulantsThe laxative habit begins innocently enough with thecorrect belief that bowels should move every day however laxatives will cause the evacuation of several days worth of stool in a single movement Impatient for stoolto reaccumulate for the necessary few days the patienttakes another laxative and the cycle begins The other major cause of constipation is a diet with insufficient bulk or roughage The bowel works moresmoothly the more contents it has Western diets of highly refined foods have eliminated most of the residuefrom food The result is that most food is absorbed leaving little to pass through and be excreted as feces Constipation occurs acutely with impactionthe pres ence in the rectum of a mass of feces too large to passFecal impaction is usually the result of poor bowelhabits a diet with too little liquid and roughage andinadequate physical activity Diarrhea whether acute or chronic can disrupt the bowels normal rhythm and lead to irregularity Several diseases of the nervous system affect bowel reflexes Description Bowel training reestablishes the bowels normal reflexes by repeating a routine until it becomes a habitNaturally the patient must be able and willing to cooperate Some patients are so convinced they need daily laxatives that they are afraid to do without them It takes timefor a changed diet to effect the bowels and for the bowel toregain its normal rhythm Trust and patience are necessary After gaining the patients cooperation the next step is to optimize the diet Healthy bowel movements requireingestion of a large amount of liquids and bulk foodsThe patient should drink two to three quarts of liquidsevery day with liberal inclusion of prune juice and perhaps coffee for their natural laxative effect Bulk comesfrom unrefined foods Oat bran wheat bran brown ricegreen vegetables apples and pears are a few examples ofhigh residue foods Many patients will benefit fromadding bulk preparations of psyllium Constipating foodslike bananas and cheese should be avoided until a naturalrhythm is well established To assure that stools are soft enough to pass easily it is a good idea to add a pure stool softener like DOSSdioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate two to four per day asneeded DOSS also helps prevent impaction There is usually a time of day when bowel move ments are more likely to occur In anticipation of thistime the patient should participate in activities that stimulate a normal bowel movement Walking eating unrefined foods and drinking prune juice or coffee encourage natural evacuation It is acceptable to use lubricantssuch as glycerine suppositories or oil enemas at this time For severe constipation water enemas may beneeded to initiate a movement It is also important for the patient to recognize the urge to defecate and to respond right away to that urgeThe longer stool sits in the rectum the more water therectum will absorb from it making it harder and moredifficult to pass Normal results With patience and diligence normal bowel habits and

growth of tissue in the brain Unlike other tumors brain tumors spread by local GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Brain tumorGEM to B PM Page extension and rarely metastasize spread outside the brain A benign brain tumor is composed of noncancerous cells and does not metastasize beyond the part of thebrain where it originates A brain tumor is consideredmalignant if it contains cancer cells or if it is composed of harmless cells located in an area where it suppressesone or more vital functions Description Each year more than brain tumors are diag nosed in the United States About half of all primarybrain tumors are benign but in lifethreatening locationsThe rest are malignant and invasive Benign brain tumors Benign brain tumors composed of harmless cells have clearly defined borders can usually be completelyremoved and are unlikely to recur Benign brain tumorsdo not infiltrate nearby tissues but can cause severe pain permanent brain damage and death Benign brain tumors sometimes become malignant Malignant brain tumors Malignant brain tumors do not have distinct borders They tend to grow rapidly increasing pressure within thebrain IICP and can spread in the brain or spinal cordbeyond the point where they originate It is highly unusual for malignant brain tumors to spread beyond the central nervous system CNS Primary brain tumors Primary brain tumors originate in the brain They represent about of all cancers and of all cancerdeaths Metastatic or secondary brain tumors Approximately of all cancer patients develop secondary or metastatic brain tumors when cancer

conditions tuberoussclerosis neurofibromatosis von Hippel Lindau famil ial polyposis OslerWeberRendu LiFraumeni Naming and grading brain tumors The name of a brain tumor describes where it origi nates how it grows and what kind of cells it contains Atumor in an adult is also graded or staged according to how malignant it is how rapidly it is growing and how likely it is to invade other tissues how closely its cells resemble normal cells The more abnormal a tumor cell looks the faster it is likely togrow Lowgrade brain tumors usually have welldefined borders Some lowgrade brain tumors form or areenclosed encapsulated in cysts Lowgrade braintumors grow slowly if at all They may spread throughout the brain but rarely metastasize to other parts of thebody Midgrade and highgrade tumors grow more rapid ly than lowgrade tumors Described as truly malignant these tumors usually infiltrate healthy tissue Thegrowth pattern makes it difficult to remove the entiretumor and these tumors recur more often than lowgradetumors A single brain tumor can contain several different types of cells The tumors grade is determined by thehighestgrade most malignant cell detected under amicroscope even if most of the cells in the tumor are lessmalignant An infiltrating tumor is a tumor of any gradethat grows into surrounding tissue GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Brain tumorGEM to B PM Page Types of brain tumors Glioma is the term used to refer to the most preva lent primary brain tumors Gliomas arise from glial tissue which supports and nourishes cells that send messages from the brain to other parts of the body Thesetumors may be either malignant or benign Astrocytomas ependymomas and mixed gliomas are three ofthe most common gliomas ASTROCYTOMAS Named for the starlike shape of their cells astrocytomas can develop on any part of thebrain or spinal cord Noninfiltrating astrocytomas growslowly and rarely spread to nearby tissue Mildtomoderately anaplastic astrocytomas with welldifferentiatedborders do not grow as slowly as noninfiltrating astrocytomas and they do spread to surrounding tissues Anaplastic astrocytomas which are also called Grade III astrocytomas look more abnormal and growmore rapidly than noninfiltrating or mildtomoderatelyanaplastic tumors Grade IV astrocytomas are also called glioblastoma multiforme GBM tumors Accounting for of allprimary brain tumors GBMs are the most common braintumors in middleaged adults GBMs are the most malignant of all brain tumors Because they contain a greatermixture of cells than any other brain tumor they are themost difficult to treat EPENDYMOMAS Also called ependymal tumors ependymomas account for of all gliomas and ofall intracranial tumors These tumors which are mostcommon in children and adolescents begin in the verythin membranes that help form cerebrospinal fluid CSFand line the brain cavities ventricles that contain it Ependymomas are usually benign have welldiffer entiated borders resemble normal cells and grow veryslowly The cells of anaplastic malignant ependymomas look abnormal and grow more rapidly than the cellsof benign tumors MIXED GLIOMAS These heterogeneous tumors con tain

enclose the brain and spinal cordmeninges These tumors are usually benign and mostoften occur in women aged years old Meningiomas grow so slowly that the brain can sometimesbecome accustomed to their presence Meningiomascompress rather than invade brain tissue and may growto be quite large before any symptoms appear SCHWANNOMAS Schwannomas originate in the Schwann cells These cells produce myelin material thatprotects the acoustic nerve which controls hearingThese benign tumors are twice as common in women asin men and are most often diagnosed in patients betweenthe ages Schwannomas grow very slowly and many people adapt to the slight hearing loss and balance problems that are the tumors earliest symptoms A pearshapedSchwannoma can cause sudden or gradual loss of hearing in an ear As the

are described as supratentorial in theupper part of the brain or infratentorial in the lowestpart of the brain Astrocytomas and ependymomas arecommon supratentorial tumors Infratentorial tumorsinclude medulloblastomas astrocytomas and ependymomas Causes and symptoms The cause of primary brain tumors is unknown but people who work with rubber and certain chemicals havea greaterthanaverage risk of developing them There is GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Brain tumorGEM to B PM Page no evidence that head injury causes brain tumors but researchers are trying to determine the relationship ifany between brain tumors and viruses family historyand longterm exposure to electromagnetic fields Symptoms do not usually appear until the tumor grows large enough to displace damage or destroy delicate

Treatment Brain tumors are treated by multidisciplinary teams of highly skilled specialists whose decisions are based on results of diagnostic tests tumor size position and growth pattern the patients health history and current medical status the wishes of the patient and his family Surgery Surgery is the treatment of choice for accessible brain tumors which can be removed without causingserious neurologic damage The procedure most oftenperformed is a craniotomy but the goals of any type of brain tumor surgery include removing as much of the tumor as possible called debulking the tumor removing tumor tissue for microscopic analysis allowing neurosurgeons to see exactly how the tumor is situated and how it is growing creating an entry channel for chemotherapy drugs and forms of radiation that are implanted in the brain Depending on the type of brain tumor its location and its size a number of different techniques may beused to surgically remove it Surgical techniques include classic operation laser microsurgery uses high temperatures to vaporize tumor cells ultrasonic aspiration uses ultrasound waves to break up the tumor into smaller bits which can be vacuumedout Before undergoing brain surgery patients are often given steroids to reduce swelling of brain tissue snticonvulsant medications to prevent or control seizures radiation treatments to reduce tumor size Patients whose benign brain tumors can be com pletely removed may not require any additional treatment but periodic physical and neurologic examinationsand CT or MRI scans are sometimes recommended todetermine whether the tumor has returned Because surgeons cannot be sure that every bit of an infiltrating ormetastasizing tumor has been removed radiation andchemotherapy are used to eradicate cells that may haveescaped the scalpel If a tumor cannot be completely removed removing a portion of it debulking can alleviate the patientssymptoms enhance the sense of wellbeing and increasethe effectiveness of other treatments Radiation therapy External radiotherapy generally delivered on an out patient basis directs radiation to the tumor and the areaaround it Implant radiation therapy involves placing tiny pieces of radioactive material in the brain Left in placepermanently or for a short time these radioactive pelletsrelease measured doses of radiation each day This technique is called brachytherapy Patients are usually hospitalized during the several days the pellets are most active Stereoactic radiosurgery involves fitting the patient with a frame to stabilize the head using imaging techniques to determine the exact location of tumor cells andusing a sophisticated instrument to administer radiationprecisely to that point Instruments used for delivery ofradiation include the gamma knife adapted linear accelerator LINAC and cyclotron A variety of drugs may also be given during radia tion therapy to protect brain cells from the effects ofradiation radioprotective drugs to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to radiation radiosensitizers or toboost radiations effects radioenhancers Chemotherapy One or more cancerkilling drugs may be taken by mouth or injected into a blood vessel muscle or the cerebrospinal fluid Chemotherapy may be used with radiation and surgery as part of a patients initial treatment orused alone to treat tumors that recur in the same place orin another part of the body The usual chemotherapy regimen for a brain tumor is a combination approach mostcommonly using procarbazine CCNU and vincristine New methods of delivering chemotherapy are being used as well These include interstitial chemotherapy is performed at the time of surgery A chemotherapysoaked wafer is placed in thecavity left after tumor removal GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Brain tumorGEM to B PM Page Intrathecal chemotherapy instills the medications right into the spinal fluid Intraarterial chemotherapy uses tiny catheter tubes to delivery highdose chemotherapy directly into the arteries of the brain Potentially toxic chemotherapy drugs can be wrapped in special biologic envelopes called liposomes to allowthe drugs to be delivered to the tumor without adverselyaffecting other healthy tissues along the way Electrochemotherapy uses electric voltage to transport chemotherapy agents into the brain When a young child has a brain tumor chemotherapy is often used to eliminate or delay the need for radiation Other treatments If a brain tumor cannot be cured treatment is designed to make the patient as comfortable as possibleand preserve as much of his neurologic functioning aspossible The patients doctor may prescribe analgesics to relieve pain anticancer drugs to limit tumor growth anticonvulsants to control seizures steroids to reduce swelling of brain tissue Potential therapies Scientists are studying ways to empower chemother apy drugs to penetrate the bloodbrain barrier whichprotects the CNS by separating the brain from blood circulating throughout the body and attack cancer cellsthat have infiltrated tissue inside it Agents under investigation include both mannitol and substances calledreceptormediated permeabilizers Brain tumor researchers are also investigating Less invasive surgical procedures Monoclonal antibodies which pair antibodies with radioactive substances The antibodies are directed tofind and attach to tumor cells at which time theradioactive substance kills the tumor cell Interleukin and interferon which are substances pro duced naturally by the human immune system whichseem to kill tumor cells Scientists seek to producethese substances in the laboratory and incorporate theiruse in brain tumor treatment Tlymphocytes which are also produced normally by the human immune system and are being used to injectdirectly into the tumor location during surgery and toinfuse into the bloodstream after surgery in the hopesthat they will boost the immune systems ability to fighttumor cells Tumor vaccines which use elements of tumor cells to stimulate the patients immune system Methods of incorporating chemotherapy drugs into tumor cells to reduce the need for radiation Laboratory techniques that enable physicians to select the chemotherapy drugs most likely to kill particulartypes of tumors Gene therapy in which genetically engineered material is transported to tumor cells by viruses that infect tumorcells and convert them to normal cells stop theirgrowth or kill them Alternative treatment Alternative treatments have not been shown to cure brain tumors and should never be substituted for conventional therapy However complementary therapies usedwith not instead of standard treatments can help somepatients cope with the stress of their illness and side effects of their treatment Biofeedback can teach patients to influence and control heart rate muscle tension and other stressrelated body functions Some patients claim that guided imagery visualization helps them feel healthier and more in control of their disease Massage meditation and reflexology help some patients relax while yoga is said to soothe the body spir it and mind Hydrotherapy uses ice liquid and steam to improve circulation and relieve pain Therapeutic touch practitioners say they can relieve pain and other symptoms by moving their hands in slow rhythmicmotions several inches above the patients body Botanical therapies homeopathic treatment tradi tional Chinese medicine treatments nutritional focuses on diet and supplements and detoxification can also be incorporated as complementary therapies Prognosis The patients prognosis depends on where the tumor is located what type of cells it contains the size of thetumor and the effect its already had on adjacent brainstructures A patient whose tumor is discovered early andremoved completely may make a full recovery but thesurgery itself can harm or destroy normal brain tissueand cause problems with thought speech and coordination seizures weakness personality changes GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Brain tumorGEM to B PM Page Although these postoperative problems may initial ly be more severe than the symptoms

surgically or by withdrawing tissue through a needle Purpose A biopsy is recommended when a significant abnormality is found either on physical examination andor by an imaging test Examples of abnormality caninclude a breast lump felt during physical self examination or tissue changes noticed from a mammogram testBefore a biopsy is performed it is important to makesure that the threat of cancer cannot be disproved or ruled out by a simpler less invasive examination Alump may be obviously harmless when examined byultrasound If this is not decisive the presence of canceror a variety of benign breast conditions can be determined using a biopsy Precautions The type of biopsy recommended should be consid ered This will depend on whether the area can be felthow well it can be seen on mammogram or ultrasoundand how suspicious it feels or appears Specializedequipment is needed for different types of biopsy andavailability may vary Generally needle biopsy is lessinvasive than surgical biopsy It is appropriate for mostbut not all situations However some surgeons feel it isfar less accurate Description Surgical biopsy If an abnormality is not felt during a self examina tion there are signs that indicate the need for medicalattention These include severe breast pain changes in the size of a breast or the nipple changes in the shape of both breast or nipple pitting dumpling or redness of the breast skin nipple redness irritation or inversion changes in the pattern of veins visible on the surface of the breast some types of nipple discharge If the abnormality is not felt a needle localization must be done before the actual surgery After local anesthetic is administered a fine wire is placed in the area ofconcern Either x ray or ultrasound guidance is used Thepatient is awake and usually sitting up There are two types of breast biopsy considered here excisional and incisional An excisional biopsy is asurgical procedure where the entire area of concern andsome surrounding tissue is removed It is usually done asan outpatient procedure in a hospital or free standingsurgery center The patient may be awake and is sometimes given medication to make her drowsy The area tobe operated on is numbed with local anesthetic Infrequently general anesthesia is used An excisional biopsy itself usually takes under one hour The total amount of time spent at the facilitydepends on the type of anesthesia used whether a needlelocalization was done and the extent of the surgery If a mass is very large an incisional biopsy may be performed In this case only a portion of the area isremoved and sent for analysis The procedure is the sameas an excisional biopsy in other respects Needle biopsy A needle biopsy removes part of the suspicious area for examination There are two types aspiration biopsyusing a fine needle and large core needle biopsy Eitherof these may be called a percutaneous needle biopsy Percutaneous refers to a procedure done through the skin A fine needle aspiration biopsy uses a very thin nee dle to withdraw fluid and cells that can be studied It canbe done in a doctors office clinic or hospital Localanesthetic may be used but is sometimes withheld as itmay be more painful than the biopsy needle The area toplace the needle may be located by touch No specializedequipment is needed However using ultrasound guidance enables the physician to feel and see the lesion atthe same time The actual withdrawing of fluid and cellscan be visualized as it occurs This helps ensure that thespecimen is taken from the right place A large core needle biopsy uses a larger diameter needle to remove small pieces of tissue about the size ofa grain of rice It can be done in a clinic or hospital thathas the appropriate facilities Local anesthetic is routine GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Breast biopsyGEM to B PM Page ly used Ultrasound or x ray is used for guidance of a large core needle biopsy If the suspicious area is seen best with x ray a stereo tactic device is used This means that x rays are taken fromseveral angles This information is fed into a computerwhich analyzes the data and guides the needle to the correctplace The patient may be sitting up or she may be lying onher stomach with her breast positioned through an openingin the table The breast is held firmly but comfortablybetween a plastic paddle and a metal plate similar to thoseused for mammograms a set of x rays taken of the frontand side of the breast X rays may be taken before duringand after the tissue is drawn into the needle to confirm thatthe correct spot is biopsied This procedure may also bereferred to as a stereotactic core biopsy or a mammotomy Ultrasound is used to guide needle placement for some lesions The patient lies on her back or side After thearea is numbed sterile gel is applied The physician placesa transducer an instrument about the size of an electricshaver over the skin This produces an image from thereflection of sound waves A special needle usually in aspring loaded device is used to obtain the tissue The procedure is observed on a monitor as it is happening Preparation A surgical breast biopsy may require the patient to have nothing to eat or drink for a period of time beforethe operation This will typically be from midnight the night before if general anesthesia is planned No foodrestrictions are necessary for needle biopsy It is advisable to eat lightly before the procedure This is especiallyimportant if the patient will be lying on her stomach for astereotactic biopsy Aftercare After a surgical biopsy the incision will be closed with stitches and covered with a bandage The bandagecan usually be removed in one or two days Stitches aretaken out approximately one week afterward Dependingon the extent of the operation normal activities can beresumed in approximately one to three days Vigorousexercise may be limited for one to three weeks The skin opening for a needle biopsy is minimal It may be closed with thin clear tape called a steri strip orcovered with a bandaid and a small gauze bandage Thepatient can return to her usual routine immediately afterthe biopsy Strenuous activity or heavy lifting is not recommended for hours Any bandages can be removedone or two days after the biopsy Risks Infection is always a possibility when the skin is broken although

cells originate in the lining of the milk glands or ducts of the breastductal epithelium defining this malignancy as a cancerCancer cells are characterized by uncontrolled divisionleading to abnormal growth and the ability of these cellsto invade normal tissue locally or to spread throughoutthe body in a process called metastasis Description Breast cancer arises in the milkproducing glands of the breast tissue Groups of glands in normal breast tissue are called lobules The products of these glands aresecreted into a ductal system that leads to the nippleDepending on where in the glandular or ductal unit of thebreast the cancer arises it will develop certain characteristics that are used to subclassify breast cancer intotypes The pathologist will denote the subtype at the timeof evaluation with the microscope Ductal carcinomabegins in the ducts lobular carcinoma has a patterninvolving the lobules or glands The more important classification is related to the evaluated tumors capability to GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Breast cancerGEM to B PM Page invade as this characteristic defines the disease as a true cancer The stage before invasive cancer is called in situ meaning that the early malignancy has not yet becomecapable of invasion Thus ductal carcinoma in situ isconsidered a minimal breast cancer How breast cancer spreads The primary tumor begins in the breast itself but once it becomes invasive it may progress beyond the breast tothe regional lymph nodes or travel metastasize to otherorgan systems in the body and become systemic in natureLymph is the clear proteinrich fluid that bathes the cellsthroughout the body Lymph will work its way back to thebloodstream via small channels known as lymphaticsAlong the way the lymph is filtered through cellular stations known as nodes thus they are called lymph nodesNearly all organs in the body have a primary lymph nodegroup filtering the tissue fluid or lymph that comes fromthat organ In the breast the primary lymph nodes areunder the armpit or axilla Classically the primary tumorbegins in the breast and the first place to which it is likelyto spread is the regional lymph nodes Cancer as itinvades in its place of origin may also work its way intoblood vessels If cancer gets into the blood vessels theblood vessels provide yet another route for the cancer tospread to other organs of the body Breast cancer follows this classic progression though it often becomes systemic or widespread early in thecourse of the disease By the time one can feel a lump inthe breast it is often inches or one centimeter in sizeand contains roughly a million cells It is estimated that atumor of this size may take one to five years to developDuring that time the cancer may metastasize or spreadby lymphatics or blood to areas elsewhere in the body When primary breast cancer spreads it may first go to the regional lymph nodes under the armpit the axillary nodes If this occurs regional metastasis exists If itproceeds elsewhere either by lymphatic or bloodbornespread the patient develops systemic metastasis that mayinvolve a number of other organs in the body Favoritesites of systemic involvement for breast cancer are thelung bones liver and the skin and soft tissue As it turnsout the presence of and the actual number of regionallymph nodes containing cancer remains the single bestindicator of whether or not the cancer has become widelymetastatic Because tests to discover metastasis in otherorgans may not be sensitive enough to reveal minutedeposits the evaluation of the axilla for regional metastasis becomes very important in making treatment decisions for this disease If breast cancer spreads to other major organs of the body its presence will compromise the function of thoseorgans Death is the result of extreme compromise of vital organ function Demographics Every woman is at risk for breast cancer If she lives to be there is a one out of nine chance that she willdevelop the condition sometime during her life As awoman ages her risk of developing breast cancer risesdramatically regardless of her family history The breastcancer risk of a yearold woman is only one out of by

die of breast cancereach year accounting for of deaths caused by cancerin women For the first time ever mortality rates decreasedan average of per year from through areflection of earlier diagnosis and improving therapies Causes and symptoms There are a number of risk factors for the develop ment of breast cancer including family history of breast cancer in mother or sister early onset of menstruation and late menopause reproductive history women who had no children or have children after age and women who have neverbreastfed have increased risk history of abnormal breast biopsies Though these are recognized risk factors it is impor tant to note that more than of women who get breastcancer have no known risk factors Having several riskfactors may boost a womans chances of developingbreast cancer but the interplay of predisposing factors iscomplex In addition to those accepted factors listedabove some studies suggest that highfat diets obesity or the use of alcohol may contribute to the risk profileAnother factor that may contribute to a womans riskprofile is hormone replacement therapy HRT HRT provides significant relief of menopausal symptoms prevention of osteoporosis and possibly pro tection from cardiovascular disease and stroke Howev er studies show that there is a small increased risk ofdeveloping breast cancer with HRT use Thus the use ofhormone replacement therapy should be based on personal risk factors Of all the risk factors listed above family history is the most important In The Biological Basis of Cancer the authors estimate that probably about half of all famil GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Breast cancerGEM to B PM Page ial breast cancer cases families in which there is a high breast cancer frequency have mutations affecting thetumor suppressor gene BRCA Another gene BRCA also appears to confer inherited vulnerability to earlyonset breast cancers However breast cancer due toheredity is only a small proportion of breast cancer casesonly of all breast cancer cases will be womenwho inherited a susceptibility through their genes Nevertheless when the family history is strong for development of breast cancer a womans risk is increased Not all lumps detected in the breast are cancerous Fibrocystic changes in the breast are extremely commonAlso known as fibrocystic condition of the breast fibro cystic changes are a leading cause of noncancerous lumpsin the breast Fibrocystic changes also cause symptoms ofpain swelling or discharge and may become evident to the patient or physician as a lump that is either solid orfilled with fluid Complete diagnostic evaluation of anysignificant breast abnormality is mandatory becausethough women commonly develop fibrocystic changesbreast cancer is common also and the signs and symptomsof fibrocystic changes overlap with those of breast cancer Diagnosis The diagnosis of breast cancer is accomplished by the biopsy of any suspicious lump or mammographic abnormality that has been identified A biopsy is the removal oftissue for examination by a pathologist A mammogram isa lowdose view xray examination of the breast Thepatient may be prompted to visit her doctor upon finding alump in a breast or she may have noticed skin dimplingnipple retraction or discharge from the nipple Or thepatient may not have noticed anything abnormal and alump is detected by the mammogram When a patient has no signs or symptoms Screening involves the evaluation of women who have no symptoms or signs of a breast problem so whenthe screening mammogram leads to the evaluation thepatient has no symptoms and may not have any abnormality on examination of the breast Mammography has been very helpful in detecting breast cancer that one cannot identify on physical examination However of breast cancer does not show up on mammography and a similar number of patients with breastcancer have an abnormal mammogram and a normalphysical examination These figures emphasize the needfor examination as part of the screening process Screening It is recommended that women get into the habit of doing monthly breast self examinations to detect anylump at an early stage If an uncertainty or a lump is found evaluation by an experienced physician and mammography is recommended The American Cancer Society ACS has made recommendations for the use ofmammography on a screening basis There has been controversy about the timing and appropriate frequency ofmammography when used as a screening tool but theACS recommendations are as follows Women shouldget annual mammograms after age Those with a significant family history one or more firstdegree relativeswho have been treated for breast cancer should startannual mammograms years younger than theyoungest relative was when she was diagnosed but notearlier than Because of the greater awareness of breast cancer in recent years screening evaluations by examinations andmammography are performed much more frequently thanin the past The result is that the number of breast cancersdiagnosed increased but the disease is being diagnosed atan earlier stage than previously The earlier the stage of GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Breast cancer Mammogram indicating a tumor in the center of the breast Chris Bjornberg Photo Researchers Reproduced by permissionGEM to B PM Page disease at the time of presentation the better the long term outcome after treatment or prognosis becomes When a patient has physical signs or symptoms A very common finding that leads to diagnosis is the presence of a lump within the breast Skin dimpling nipple retraction or discharge from the nipple are less frequent initial findings prompting biopsy Though bloodynipple discharge is distressing it is most often caused bybenign disease Skin dimpling or nipple retraction in thepresence of an underlying breast mass on examination isa more advanced finding Actual skin involvement withedema or ulceration of the skin are late findings A very common presenting sign is the presence of a breast lump If the lump is suspicious and the patient hasnot had a mammogram by this point a study should bedone on both breasts prior to anything else so that theoriginal characteristics of the lesion can be studied Theopposite breast should also be evaluated mammographically to determine if other problems exist that were undetected by physical examination Whether an abnormal screening mammogram or one of the signs mentioned above followed by a mammogramprompted suspicion the diagnosis is established byobtaining tissue by biopsy of the area There are differenttypes of biopsy each utilized with its own indicationdepending on the presentation of the patient If signs ofwidespread metastasis are already present biopsy of themetastasis itself may establish diagnosis Biopsy Depending on the situation different types of biopsy may be performed The types include incisional and excisional biopsies In an incisional biopsy the physiciantakes a sample of tissue and in excisional biopsy themass is removed Fine needle aspiration biopsy and coreneedle biopsy are kinds of incisional biopsies FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY In a fine needle aspiration biopsy a finegauge needle may be passed intothe lesion and cells from the area suctioned into the needle can be quickly prepared for microscopic evaluationcytology The patient experiencing nipple dischargecan have a sample taken of the discharge for cytologicalevaluation also Fine needle aspiration is a simple procedure that can be done under local anesthesia and willtell if the lesion is a fluidfilled cyst or whether it is solidThe sample obtained will yield much diagnostic information Fine needle aspiration biopsy is an excellent technique when the lump is palpable and the physician caneasily hit the target with the needle If the lesion is a simple cyst the fluid will be evacuated and the mass willdisappear If it is solid the diagnosis may be obtained Care must be taken however because if the mass is solidand the specimen is nonmalignant a complete removalof the lesion may be appropriate to be sure CORE NEEDLE BIOPSY Core needle biopsies are also obtained simply under local anesthesia The larger pieceof tissue obtained with its preserved architecture may behelpful in confirming the diagnosis short of open surgicalremoval An open surgical incisional biopsy is rarelyneeded for diagnosis because of the needle techniques Ifthere remains question as to diagnosis a complete opensurgical biopsy may be required EXCISIONAL BIOPSY When performed the excision al complete removal biopsy is a minimal outpatientprocedure often done under local anesthesia NONPALPABLE LESIONS As screening increases nonpalpable lesions demonstrated only by mammography are becoming more common The use of x rays andcomputers to guide the needle for biopsy or to placemarkers for the surgeon performing the excisional biopsyare commonly employed Some benign lesions can befully removed by multiple directed core biopsies Thesetechniques are very appealing because they are minimally invasive however the physician needs to be careful toobtain a good sample Other tests If a lesion is not palpable and has simple cystic char acteristics on mammography ultrasound may be utilizedboth to determine that it is a cyst and to guide its evacuation Ultrasound may also be used in some cases to guidefine needle or core biopsies of the breast Computed tomography CT scan CAT scans and magnetic resonance imaging MRI have only a very occasional use in the evaluation of breast lesions Treatment Staging Once diagnosis is established before treatment is rendered more tests are done to determine if the cancerhas spread beyond the breast These tests include a chest x ray and blood count with liver function tests Along with the liver function measured by the blood sample thelevel of alkaline phosphatase an enzyme from bone isalso determined A radionuclear bone scan may beordered This test looks at the places in the body to whichbreast cancer usually metastasizes A CT scan may alsobe ordered The physician will do a careful examinationof the axilla to assess likelihood of regional metastasisbut unfortunately this exam is not very accurate Since GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Breast cancerGEM to B PM Page the axillary node status is the best reflection of possible widespread disease these nodes in part or all will beremoved at the time of surgical treatment Using the results of these studies clinical stage is defined for the patient This helps define treatment protocol and prognosis After surgical treatment the final orpathologic stage is defined as the true axillary lymphnode status is known Detailed staging criteria are available from the American Joint Commission on CancerManual and are generalized here Stage The cancer is no larger than cm in and no cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes Stage The cancer is between cm and cm and the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes Stage ATumor is larger than cm in or is small er than cm but has spread to the lymph nodes whichhave grown into each other Stage BCancer has spread to tissues near the breast local invasion or to lymph nodes inside the chestwall along the breastbone Stage Cancer has spread to skin and lymph nodes beyond the axilla or to other organs of the body Treatment Surgery radiation and chemotherapy are all uti lized in the treatment of breast cancer Depending on thestage they will be used in different combinations orsequences to effect an appropriate strategy for the typeand stage of the disease being treated SURGERY Historically surgical removal of the entire breast and axillary contents along with the musclesdown to the chest wall was performed as the lone therapy radical mastectomy In the last twentyfive years as it has been appreciated that breast cancer is often systemic early in its course the role of surgery is still primary but of less and less magnitude Today surgical treatment is best thought of as a combination of removal of the primary tumor and staging of the axillary lymph nodes If the whole breast isremoved along with the entire axillary contents but themuscles of the chest wall are not the modified radicalmastectomy has been performed If the tumor is less than in cm in size and located so that it can be removed without destroying areasonable cosmetic appearance of the residual breastjust the primary tumor and a rim of normal tissue will beremoved The axillary nodes will still be removed forstaging purposes usually through a separate incisionBecause of the risk of recurrence in the remaining breasttissue radiation is used to lessen the chance of localrecurrence This type of primary therapy is known as lumpectomy or segmental mastectomy and axillary dissection Currently the necessary extent of the axillary dissec tion is being questioned Sentinel lymph node biopsy a technique for identifying which nodes in the axilla drainthe tumor has been developed to provide selective sampling and further lessen the degree of surgical trauma thepatient experiences When patients are selected appropriately based on the preoperative clinical stage all of these surgicalapproaches have been shown to produce similar resultsIn planning primary surgical therapy it is imperative thatthe operation is tailored to fit the clinical circumstance ofthe patient The pathologic stage is determined after surgical treatment absolutely defines the local parameters Inaddition to stage there are other tests that are very necessary to aid in decisions regarding treatment Handling ofthe surgical specimen is thus very important The tissueneeds to be analyzed for the presence or absence of hormone receptors and a receptor

the axillary lymph nodestatus to define the anticipated aggressiveness of the cancer This assessment along with the age and general condition of the patient will be considered when planningthe adjuvant therapies Adjuvant therapies are treatmentsutilized after the primary treatment to help ensure that nomicroscopic disease exists and to help prolong patientssurvival time RADIATION Like surgical therapy radiation thera pyis a local modalityit treats the tissue exposed to it and not the rest of the body Radiation is usually givenpostoperatively after surgical wounds have healed The pathologic stage of the primary tumor is now known andthis aids in treatment planning The extent of the localsurgery also influences the planning Radiation may notbe needed at all after modified radical mastectomy forstage I disease but is almost always utilized when breastpreserving surgery is performed If the tumor was extensive or if multiple nodes were involved the field of tissueexposed will vary accordingly Radiation is utilized as anadjunct to surgical therapy and is considered an importantmodality in gaining local control of the tumor The use ofradiation therapy does not affect decisions for adjuvanttreatment In the past radiation was used as an alternativeto surgery on occasion However now that breastpreserving surgical protocols have been developed primaryradiation treatment of the tumor is no longer performedRadiation also has an important role in the treatment ofthe patient with disseminated disease particularly if itinvolves the skeleton Radiation therapy can effect paincontrol and prevention of fracture in this circumstance DRUG THERAPY Many breast cancers particularly those originating in postmenopausal women areresponsive to hormones These cancers have receptors ontheir cells for estrogen and progesterone Part of primarytumor assessment after removal of the tumor is the evaluation for the presence of these estrogen and progesteronereceptors If they are present on the cancer cells alteringthe hormone status of the patient will inhibit tumorgrowth and have a positive impact on survival The drugtamoxifen binds up these receptors on the cancer cells sothat the hormones cant have an effect and in so doinginhibits tumor growth If the patient has these receptorspresent tamoxifen is commonly prescribed for five yearsas an adjunct to primary treatment Adjuvant hormonaltherapy with tamoxifen has few side effects but they haveto be kept in mind particularly the need for yearly evaluation of the uterus Other agents directed at altering hormone environment are under study Because of these agents there is rarely any need for surgical removal ofhormoneproducing glands such as the ovary or adrenalthat was sometimes necessary in the past Shortly after the modified radical mastectomy replaced the radical mastectomy as primary surgicaltreatment it was appreciated that survival after localtreatment in stage II breast cancer was improved by theaddition of chemotherapy Adjuvant chemotherapy for aninterval of four to six months is now standard treatmentfor patients with stage II disease The addition of systemic therapy to local treatment in patients who have noevidence of disease is performed on the basis that somepatients have metastasis that are not currently demonstrable because they are microscopic By treating the wholepatient early before widespread disease is diagnosed theadjuvant treatment improves survival rates from roughly for stage II to about at five years after treatment The standard regimen of cytoxan methotrexateand flourouracil CMF is given for six months and iswell tolerated The regimen of cytoxan adriamycin doxorubicin and floururacil CAF is a bit more toxicbut only requires four months Adriamycin and cytoxinmay also be used alone without the fluorouracil Thetwo methods are about equivalent in results Adjuvanthormonal therapy may be added to the adjuvant chemotherapy as they work through different routes As one would expect the encouraging results from adjuvant therapy in stage II disease have led to the studyof similar therapy in stage I disease The results are notas dramatic but they are real Currently stage I disease isdivided into categories a b and c on the basis of tumorsize Stage Ia is less than a centimeter in diameter Adjuvant hormonal or chemotherapy is now commonly recommended for stage Ib and Ic patients The toxicity ofthe treatment must be weighed individually for thepatient as patients with stage I disease have a survivorship of over without adjuvant chemotherapy If patients are diagnosed with stage IV disease or in spite of treatment progress to a state of widespread disease systemic chemotherapy is utilized in a moreaggressive fashion In addition to the adriamycincontaining regimens the taxols docetaxel and paclitaxelhave been found to be effective in inducing remission On the basis of prognostic factors such as total num ber of involved nodes over aneuploid DNA with ahigh synthesis value or aggressive findings on microscopic evaluation some patients with stage II or III disease can be predicted to do poorly If their performancestatus allows they can be considered for treatment withhighly aggressive chemotherapy The toxicity is such thatbone marrow failure will result To get around this antici GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Breast cancerGEM to B PM Page pated side effect of the aggressive therapy either the patients will be transplanted with their own stem cellsthe cells that will give rise to new marrow or a traditional bone marrow transplantation will be required This therapy can be a highrisk procedure for patients Itis given with known risk to patients predicted to do poorly and then only if it is felt they can tolerate it Mostpatients who receive this therapy receive it as part of aclinical trial At present it is unclear that such aggressivetherapy can be justified and it is under study For patients who are diagnosed with advanced local disease surgery may be preceded with chemotherapyand radiation therapy The disease locally regressesallowing traditional surgical treatment to those whocould not receive it otherwise Chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy will continue after the surgeryThe regimens of this type are referred to as neoadjuvanttherapy This has been proven to be effective in stage IIIdisease Neoadjuvant therapy is now being studied inpatients with large tumors that are stage II in an effort tobe able to offer breast preservation to these patients A drug known

is common after breast cancer treatment to be depressed or moody to cry lose appetite or feel unworthy or less interested in sex The breast is involved with awomans identity and loss of it may be disturbing Forsome counseling or a support group can help Manywomen have found a support group of breast cancer survivors to be an invaluable help during this stage Involvement with volunteers from the local chapter of the Reachto Recovery program may be very helpful Nearly all patients undergo some form of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer The magnitude of the toxicity ofthese adjuvant therapies is usually small and many patientsreceiving chemotherapy on this basis are capable of normalactivity during this time Certainly those who progress toadvanced disease are treated with more toxic chemotherapeutic regimens in an attempt to induce remission Clinical trials The use of tamoxifen and other agents which alter the hormone status of the patient are under study TheNational Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel ProjectNSABP with support from the National Cancer Institute began a study in called the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial or BCPT studying the use of tamoxifen asa breast cancer preventative for highrisk women Theresults yielded from the study showed that tamoxifen significantly reduced breast cancer risk and the US Foodand Drug Administration approved the use of tamoxifento reduce breast cancer risk for highrisk patients in Another NSABP study known as STAR is seeking to understand if another drug raloxifene is as effective as tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer risk in highrisk patients That study was begun in and participants are to be monitored for five years Neoadjuvant therapies to allow the use of breast preservation in those with more advanced local diseaseare under investigation Immune therapies have not been helpful to date though there are vaccines being developed against proteins such as that produced by HER that may be beneficial in the futureHighdose chemotherapy with bone marrow rescue remains controversial Factors can be identified that predict certain patients will develop metastatic disease Thistreatment has been offered to this select group of patientsbut the toxicity is such that defining a clear indication forthis treatment remains under study Prevention As mentioned above because of the results yielded from the BCPT clinical trial tamoxifen can now be prescribed to highrisk women to help prevent breast cancer And while most breast cancer cant be prevented it can be diagnosed from a mammogram at an early stagewhen it is most treatable The results of awareness androutine screening have allowed earlier diagnosis whichresults in a better prognosis for those discovered Special Concerns Though breastpreserving therapy is being done more frequently than in years past modified radical mastectomyremains an option when selecting therapy for the primarytumor This option may allow treatment without radiationin earlier stage patients or may be necessary if the presentation of the tumor does not allow breast preservation Lossof the breast is disfiguring and many patients so treateddesire reconstruction of the breast Breast reconstruction is performed either at the time of initial surgery immediate or it may be delayed Alternatives include placement ofimplants or the rotation of muscle flaps from the

for enlarging the breast Breastshaped sacks made of a silicone outer shell and filled with silicone gel or saline saltwater called implants are used Purpose Breast implantation is usually performed to make normal breasts larger for cosmetic purposes Sometimesa woman having a breast reconstruction after a mastec tomy will need the opposite breast enlarged to make thebreasts more symmetric Breasts that are very unequal in size due to trauma or congenital deformity may also becorrected with an enlargement procedure Precautions A woman in poor health or with a severe chronic disease is not a good candidate for this procedure Description A cosmetic breast enlargement is usually an outpa tient procedure It may be done under local or generalanesthesia depending on patient and physician preference The incision is made through the armpit under thebreast or around the areola the darkened area aroundthe nipple These techniques create the most inconspicuous scars The implant is placed between the breast tissueand underlying chest muscle or under the chest muscleThe operation takes approximately one to two hours Thecost of a cosmetic procedure is rarely covered by insur GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF

after a mastectomy health plans may pay forsome or all of it The surgeons fee ranges from and up The procedure may also be called breastaugmentation or augmentation mammaplasty Preparation Before the surgery is performed the woman should have a clear understanding of what her new breasts willlook like She and her physician should agree about thedesired final result Many surgeons find it helpful to havethe patient review before and after pictures to clarifyexpectations Aftercare Driving and normal activities may be restricted for up to one week Stitches are usually removed in seven to days Typically a woman can resume all routinesincluding vigorous exercise in about three weeks The scars will be red for approximately one month but willfade to their final appearance within one or two years Risks Risks which are common to any surgical procedure include bleeding infection anesthesia reaction or unexpected scarring A breast enlargement may also result indecreased sensation in the breast or interference withbreastfeeding Implants can also make it more difficultto read and interpret mammograms possibly delayingbreast cancer detection Also the implant itself can rup ture and leak or become displaced A thick scar that normally forms around the implant called a capsule canbecome very hard This is called capsular contractureand may result in pain andor an altered appearance of the breast The older the implant the greater the chancesthat these problems will occur There has been intermittent publicity about possible health risks from breast implants Most concerns havefocused

performed to recreate a breast Reconstructions arecommonly done after one or both breasts are removed asa treatment for breast cancer Also a breast may need to be refashioned for other reasons such as trauma orabnormalities that occur during breast development Purpose Many authorities consider reconstruction an integral part of the therapy for breast cancer A breast that appears natural offers a sense of wholeness and normalcy which can aid in the psychological recovery frombreast cancer It eliminates the need for an external prosthesis false breast which many women find physicallyuncomfortable as well as inconvenient Precautions Not all women are good candidates for breast recon struction Overall poor physical health or specific problems such as cigarette smoking obesity high blood pressure or diabetes will increase the chance of complications Also a difficult andor prolonged recovery period or failure of the reconstruction may be a result Awomans physical ability to cope with major surgery andrecuperation also need to be considered Description Breast reconstruction is done in two stages with the ultimate goal of creating a breast which looks and feelsas natural as possible It is important to remember that GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Breast reconstructionGEM to B PM Page while a good result may mimic a normal breast closely there will inevitably be scars and loss of sensation Thereconstructed breast cannot be exactly like the original The first step is to form a structure called a breast mound This can be accomplished using artificial materialscalled breast implants or by using tissues from other parts of the womans body The second step involves creating abalance between the newly constructed breast and thebreast on the opposite side The nipple and areolar complexdarker area around the nipple are recreated This is usually done several months after the mound is created to allowswelling to go down Other procedures may be necessarysuch as lifting the opposite breast mastopexy or makingit larger or smaller to match the reconstructed breast Timing immediate or delayed reconstruction While immediate reconstruction IR is not recom mended for women with breast cancer who need to undergo other more important treatments breast reconstructioncan be done almost anytime It even can be done during thesame procedure as the mastectomy or it can be delayed There are psychological benefits to IR The ability to returnto normal activities and routines is often enhanced whenreconstruction follows immediately after mastectomy Abetter appearance may result from IR There is less skinremoval often resulting in a shorter scar The surgeon isbetter able to preserve the normal boundaries of the breastso it is easier to match the opposite breast more closely The cost of IR is generally lower than the cost of delayed reconstruction DR There is one fewer operation and hospital stay Surgeons fees may be lower for acombined procedure than for two separate surgeries There are disadvantages of IR as well The surgery itself is longer causing more time under anesthesiaPostoperative pain and recovery time will be greater than for mastectomy alone Other authorities contend that delayed reconstruc tion DR offers different physical and psychologicaladvantages The initial mastectomy procedure alonetakes less time and has a shorter recovery period and lesspain than mastectomy and IR The patient has more timeto adjust to her diagnosis and recover from additionaltherapy She is better able to research her options and toformulate realistic goals for reconstruction Some reconstructive surgery requires blood transfusions With DRthe patient can donate her own blood ahead of timeautologous transfusion andor arrange to have family and friends donate blood for her use directed donation The psychological stress of living without a breast is a disadvantage of DR The extra procedure DR entailsresults in higher costs Although initial recovery is fasteran additional recuperation period is required after the delayed operation Type of reconstruction There are two basic choices for breast reconstruc tion The breast tissue can be replaced with an implant orthe breast is created using some of the womans own tissues autologous reconstruction ARTIFICIAL IMPLANTS In general implant proce dures take less time and are less expensive than autologous ones Implants are breast shaped pouches They aremade of silicone outer shells which may be smooth ortextured The inside may contain silicone gel saline saltwater or a combination of both An implant may be a fixed volume type which can not change its size Implants that have the capacity to befilled after insertion are called tissue expanders Thesemay be temporary or permanent The initial procedure for any implant insertion uses the mastectomy incision to make a pocket of tissue usually underneath the chest wall muscle In DR the mastectomy scar may be re opened and used for this purposeor a more cosmetic incision may be made The implant isinserted into the pocket the skin is stretched as neededand stitched closed If there is inadequate tissue to achieve the desired size or a naturally sagging breast is desired a tissue expander isused It resembles a partially deflated balloon with anattached valve or port through which saline can be injectedAfter the initial surgical incision is healed the womanreturns to the doctors office on a weekly or biweeklybasis to have small amounts of saline injected Injectionscan continue for about six to eight weeks until the preferredsize is obtained In some cases it may be overfilled and laterpartially deflated to allow for a more pliable natural resultA temporary tissue expander will be removed after severalmonths and replaced with a permanent implant IR surgery using an implant takes approximately two to three hours and usually requires up to a three dayhospital stay Implant insertion surgery as part of DRtakes one to two hours and can sometimes be done as anoutpatient or it or it may entail overnight hospitalization AUTOLOGUS RECONSTRUCTION Attached flap and free flap are two types of surgery where a womans tissueis used in reconstruction An attached flap uses skin muscle and fat leaving blood vessels attached to their original source of blood The flap is maneuvered to the reconstruction site keeping its original blood supply for nourishment This may also be known as a pedicle flap Thesecond kind of surgery is called a free flap This also usesskin muscle and fat but severs the blood vessels and GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Breast reconstructionGEM to B PM Page attaches them to other vessels where the new breast is to be created The surgeon uses a microscope to accomplishthis delicate task of sewing blood vessels together Sometimes the term microsurgery is used to refer to free flapprocedures Either type of surgery may also be called amyocutaneous flap referring to the skin and muscle used The skin and muscle used in autologous reconstruc tion can come from one of several possible places on thebody including the abdomen TRAM flap or tummytuck the

Definition Breast ultrasound or sonography is an imaging technique for diagnosing breast disease such as cancer It uses harmless high frequency sound waves to form animage sonogram The sound waves pass through thebreast and bounce back or echo from various tissues toform a picture of the internal structures It is not invasiveand involves no radiation Purpose Breast ultrasound may be used in several ways The most common application is to investigate a specific areaof the breast where a problem is suspected A palpablelump andor a lump or density discovered by x raymammogram can be further evaluated by ultrasound Itis especially helpful in distinguishing between a fluidfilled cyst and a solid mass It can also identify smalllesions that are too tiny to be felt Breast ultrasound is often the first study performed to evaluate masses in women under whose mammogramscan be difficult to interpret due to the density of theirbreast tissue The lack of radiation used with ultrasoundmakes it ideal for studying breast abnormalities in womenwho are pregnant Assessing breast implants for leakage or rupture is another way ultrasound is used Breastinflammation where pockets of infection or abscessesmay form can be diagnosed and monitored by ultrasound Thickened and swollen breast skin may be a sign of inflammatory breast cancer Ultrasound can sometimes identify a cancerous growth within the breast causing thethickened skin These cases are usually followed by acore biopsy guided by ultrasound described below Breast ultrasound is employed to observe and guide a needle for several

treatment for a lesion that is likely to be cancerous and needle localization insurgical breast biopsy Biopsies guided by ultrasound have distinct advantages The ultrasound guides the needle sothat a

first Between of fetuses will start labor in thebreech position which is a potentially dangerous situationDescription Throughout most of pregnancy the developing fetus is completely free to move around within theuterus Between weeks it becomes so large thatmovement is restricted It is much harder for the fetus toturn over so whatever position it has assumed by thispoint is likely to be the same position that he or she willbe in when labor begins For reasons that are not fully understood almost all unborn babies settle into a head down position The fetusis upside down in the uterus and the head will lead theway during the birth process Unfortunately some fetuses do not cooperate Most of these are in the breech position The buttocks lead theway out of the uterus and the legs are folded in front ofthe body frank breech Delivery from the breech position poses far more risks than delivery head first vertexposition The biggest part of the fetuss body is usually its head If the head fits through the mothers pelvis thenthe rest of the fetuss body should slip out fairly easily Ifthe fetus is born bottom first it is possible that the bodywill fit through the mothers pelvis but the babys headwill get stuck at the level of the chin This conditionknown as a trapped head is very dangerous When the babys head comes first it has a chance to mold during labor The bones of the babys skull arenot yet fastened together the way they are in a child oradults skull meaning that the bones of the babys skullcan move During the long hours of labor the skull canchange shape to fit through the pelvis more easily whichis why many babies are born with a cone head If thebaby is born from the breech position the skull does nothave a chance to change shape to fit the pelvis and it iseven more likely to get stuck If the babys head gets trapped the possibility of injury is high Once the babys body is born the umbilicalcord usually stops pulsating just as it would during a normal delivery This cuts off the oxygen supply from themother to the baby If the babys head is still inside theuterus the baby cannot yet breathe on its own Thereforeit is essential to deliver the baby as quickly as possible The life saving attempts to deliver the babys head can cause injury to the babys neck or head resulting inpermanent handicaps In extreme cases if the baby cannot be delivered within a few minutes the baby mightdie Obviously it is critical to avoid a breech deliverywith a trapped head Of course many babies are safely delivered from the breech position There are certain factors that make abreech delivery more likely to be successful if ultra GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Breech birthGEM to B PM Page sound a technique that uses sound waves to visualize the fetus shows that the fetus is in the frank breech positionthe fetuss head is tucked on its chest and the fetus is notbig it is less likely that its head will get stuck Among breech babies born after the full ninemonth term smaller babies usually do better This is not true forpremature babies Premature babies are more likely to havea trapped head because the body of a premature baby isusually much smaller than his or her head Prematurebabies are generally not delivered from the breech position The risks of vaginal breech delivery can be avoided by delivering the baby through a surgical procedure cesarean section also known as csection For the past twenty years cesarean section has been recommended when thefetus is breech More recently many providers have offeredthe option of version attempting to turn the fetus within theuterus to a head first position before labor begins Version is based on a very simple idea If a fetus in the breech position does a somersault it will end up headdown During a version the obstetrician tries to make thefetus do a somersault A version should only be done in a hospital with an ultrasound machine used to guide the obstetrician inturning the fetus The fetus should be monitored with afetal monitor before and after the version Some obstetricians give the mother an injection of medication to relaxthe mothers uterus and prevent any contractions During the procedure the obstetrician places his or her hands on the mothers abdomen to feel the location ofthe unborn babys buttocks and head The buttocks arelifted up slightly and the doctor pushes on the babyshead to encourage him to perform a somersault It maytake several tries before the fetus cooperates but overhalf will eventually turn A version is not appropriate for every fetus who is in the breech position at the end of pregnancy It can only betried if there is one fetus in the uterus if the placenta is notlying in front of the fetus and if the umbilical cord doesnot appear to be wrapped around the fetus at any point Causes and symptoms The cause of breech birth is not known There are generally no identifiable symptoms However somewomen can tell the position of the fetus by where theyfeel the fetus kicking Most women cannot tell whatposition the fetus is in at any given moment Diagnosis A health care provider can often tell the position of the fetus by feeling it through the wall of the mothersabdomen Another clue to the position is the location where the heartbeat is heard best If the fetuss heartbeatis best heard below the level of the mothers navel it islikely to be positioned head first On the other hand ifthe heartbeat is best heard above the level of the navel itis likely to be breech The only way to really be sure however is to do an ultrasound exam Using this technique it is very easy totell the position of the fetus Treatment If a fetus is in the breech position in the last weeks of pregnancy there are three possible courses of action Cesarean section attempted version or vaginal breech delivery Cesarean section is the most common way to deliver a breech baby This surgical procedure carries more riskfor the mother but many women prefer to take the risk ofsurgery on themselves rather than let the baby face therisks of breech delivery Version is gaining in popularity Version is a medical procedure in which the

the bronchial tubes is permanently and abnormally wideneddilated with accompanying infection Description The bronchial tubes are the networks of branching tubes which deliver air to the tiny sacs of the lungs alveoli In bronchiectasis the diameter of the bronchi isunusually large Examination of the walls of the bronchialtubes reveals destruction of the normal structural elementswith replacement by scar tissue Pus collects within thebronchi and the normal flow of oxygen into the lungs andcarbon dioxide out of the lungs air exchange is impairedThe bronchi show signs of inflammation with swellingand invasion by a variety of immune cells The inflamedareas show signs of increased growth of blood vessels Thearea of the lung which should be served by a diseasedbronchial tube is also prone to inflammation and infectionCauses and symptoms Prior to the widespread use of immunizations bronchiectasis was often the result of a serious infectionwith either measles or whooping cough Currently viruses that cause influenza flu or influenzalike syn dromes as well as a number of bacteria may precede thedevelopment of bronchiectasis Patients who have beeninfected with tuberculosis or the virus which causes AIDS HIV or human immunodeficiency virus also have an increased chance of bronchiectasis A number of preexisting conditions may cause an individual to be more susceptible than normal to infection with increased risk of bronchiectasis developingThese conditions include disorders of cilia and immunedisorders Cilia are the tiny hairs which usually line the bronchial tubes Cilia wave constantly sweeping thebronchial tubes clean of bacterial or viral invaders andcleaning away excess secretions mucus sputum whichmay be produced by the bronchi When these cilia areabnormal or absent at birth various bacterial or viralinvaders may remain in the respiratory tract multiplyand cause serious infections Immune disorders include decreased production of certain immune chemicals immunoglobulins whichusually serve to fight off infection by bacterial or viralinvasion When these immunoglobulins are not producedin large enough quantity bacterial and viral invaders arenot effectively killed off and infection occurs Other causes of bronchiectasis include an abnormal ly blocked obstructed airway This can be due to tumorgrowth within the bronchial tube or due to a child accidentally inhaling a small object which then blocks off thebronchial tube People with the disease called cystic fibrosis CF often have their bronchial tubes obstructed by the thick sticky mucus which is a hallmark of CFToxic exposures breathing ammonia for example canharm the bronchi and lead to bronchiectasis An extremeallergic response of the immune system to the presenceof certain fungi especially one called Aspergillus can also damage the bronchial tubes enough to result inbronchiectasis Symptoms of bronchiectasis include constant cough and the production of infected sputum sputum is a mixture of mucus and pus which may be bloody In somecases there may be wheezing and shortness of breath The constant lowlevel of infection may flare resultingin increased production of sputum worsening of thecough and fever The area of the lung served by the affected bronchial tube may become severely infectedresulting in pneumonia GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BronchiectasisGEM to B PM

cultured grown in a laboratorydish in order to examine it microscopically for the specific type of organism responsible for infection A carefulsearch for other underlying diseases is important looking in particular for ciliary abnormalities cystic fibrosisor immunoglobulin deficiencies Treatment Treatment should involve efforts to resolve any underlying disorder Infections will require antibiotics obstruction may require the removal of a foreign object ortumor Medications are available to help thin the sputumso that it can be more effectively coughed up Rhythmicclapping on the chest and back while the patient assumesa number of positions head down primarily may helpthe lungs to drain more effectively This is called chest physical therapy or percussion and postural drainage When a particular area of the lung is constantly and severely infected surgery may be needed to remove it Whenbleeding occurs from irritated bronchial tubes and overgrown bronchial blood vessels surgery may be requiredeither to remove an area of the bronchial tube or to inject thebleeding blood vessel with a material to stop the bleeding In some patients bronchiectasis eventually leads to a constantly low level of blood oxygen despite other treatments These patients usually have an associated increasein the size of the right side of their hearts along with adecrease in the hearts ability to pump

treatments are different Acute bronchitis is most prevalent inwinter It usually follows a viral infection such as a coldor the flu and can be accompanied by a secondary bacterial infection Acute bronchitis resolves within two weeksalthough the cough may persist longer Acute bronchitis like any upper airway inflammatory process can increasea persons likelihood of developing pneumonia Anyone can get acute bronchitis but infants young children and the elderly are more likely to get the disease because people in these age groups generally haveweaker immune systems Smokers and people with heartor other lung diseases are also at higher risk of developing acute bronchitis Individuals exposed to chemicalfumes or high levels of air pollution also have a greaterchance of developing acute bronchitis Chronic bronchitis is a major cause of disability and death in the United States The American Lung Associa tion estimates that about million Americans sufferfrom the disease Like acute bronchitis chronic bronchitis is an inflammation of airways accompanied by coughing and spitting up of phlegm In chronic bronchitisthese symptoms are present for at least three months ineach of two consecutive years Chronic bronchitis is caused by inhaling bronchial irritants especially cigarette smoke Until recently moremen than women developed chronic bronchitis but asthe number of women who smoke has increased so hastheir rate of chronic bronchitis Because this disease progresses slowly middleaged and older people are morelikely to be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis Chronic bronchitis is one of a group of diseases that fall under the name chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD Other diseases in this category includeemphysema and chronic asthmatic bronchitis Chronic bronchitis may progress to emphysema or both diseasesmay be present together Causes and symptoms Acute bronchitis Acute bronchitis usually begins with the symptoms of a cold such as a runny nose sneezing and dry coughHowever the cough soon becomes deep and painful Coughing brings up a greenish yellow phlegm or sputumThese symptoms may be accompanied by a fever of up to F C Wheezing after coughing is common In uncomplicated acute bronchitis the fever and most other symptoms except the cough disappear afterthree to five days Coughing may continue for severalweeks Acute bronchitis is often complicated by a bacterial infection in which case the fever and a general feeling of illness persist To be cured the bacterial infectionshould be treated with antibiotics Chronic bronchitis Chronic bronchitis is caused by inhaling respiratory tract irritants The most common irritant is cigarettesmoke The American Lung Association estimates that of COPD cases are caused by smoking Other irritants include chemical fumes air pollution and environmental irritants such as mold or dust Chronic bronchitis develops slowly over time The cells that line the respiratory system contain fine hairlike outgrowths from the cell called cilia Normally thecilia of many cells beat rhythmically to move mucusalong the airways When smoke or other irritants areinhaled the cilia become paralyzed or snap off Whenthis occurs the cilia are no longer able to move mucusand the airways become inflamed narrowed andclogged This leads to difficulty breathing and canprogress to the lifethreatening disease emphysema A mild cough sometimes called smokers cough is usually the first visible sign of chronic bronchitisCoughing brings up phlegm although the amount variesconsiderably from person to person Wheezing andshortness of breath may accompany the cough Diag nostic tests show a decrease in lung function As the disease advances breathing becomes difficult and activitydecreases The body does not get enough oxygen leading to changes in the composition of the blood Diagnosis Initial diagnosis of bronchitis is based on observing the patients symptoms and health history The physicianwill listen to the patients chest with a stethoscope forspecific sounds that indicate lung inflammation such asmoist rales and crackling and wheezing that indicatesairway narrowing Moist rales is a bubbling sound heardwith a

coughdeeply then spit the material that comes up from the lungssputum into a cup This sample is then grown in the laboratory to determine which organisms are present Theresults are available in two to

bronchoscopy In this procedure the patient is given a local anesthetic and a tube is passed into the airways to collect a sputum sample A pulmonary function test is important in diagnos ing chronic bronchitis and other variations of COPDThis test uses an instrument called a spirometer to measure the volume of air entering and leaving the lungsThe test is done in the doctors office and is

airways of the lungs allowing more airto flow through them Purpose People with asthma have trouble breathing because their airways are inflamed and become narrowed Normally air moves smoothly from the mouth and nosethrough the airways and into the tiny air sacs of the lungsas a person breathes in Breathing out exhaling happensautomatically when the person stops breathing in In aperson with asthma breathing in inhaling is not a problem Incoming air can slide around the blockage becausethe act of breathing in makes the airways expand Theproblem comes when the person with asthma tries tobreathe out The air can no longer get past the blockageand it remains trapped in the lungs The person can thenonly take shallow breaths Bronchodilators work byrelaxing the smooth muscles that line the airways Thismakes the airways open wider and allows air to leave thelungs These drugs also are used to relieve breathingproblems associated with emphysema chronic bronchi tis and other lung diseases GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BronchodilatorsGEM to B PM Page Description Some bronchodilators are inhaled using a nebulizer or an inhalation aerosol Others are taken as injections orby mouth Most are

Atrovent metaproterenol AlupentMetaprel and terbutaline Brethine Recommended dosage The recommended dosage depends on the type of bronchodilator and may be different for differentpatients Check with the physician who prescribed thedrug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for thecorrect dosage Precautions Bronchodilators come with patient instructions Be sure to carefully read them before using the medicine Ifthere is any confusion about how to use the medicinecheck with the physician or pharmacist Always use thesemedicines exactly as directed Taking larger than recommended doses or using the medicine too often can lead toserious side effects and even death If symptoms do not improve or if they get worse after using a bronchodilator call a physician right away Although some bronchodilators are available with out a physicians prescription these medicines shouldnot be used unless a physician has diagnosed thepatients condition as asthma Some asthma experts believe that the overuse of bronchodilators can cause asthma to get worse Theyadvise patients and their physicians to consider controlling asthma with antiinflammatory drugs includinginhaled steroids such as beclomethasone dipropionateBeclovent Vanceril flunisolide AeroBid or triamcinolone acetonide Azmacort Ideally asthma should becontrolled with an inhaled steroid that is used along withthe bronchodilator The more the inhaled steroid steroidcontrols the inflammation that causes the asthma the lessbronchodilator the patient needs to use because symptoms are under control Persons with diabetes should be aware that the bron chodilator epinephrine may raise their blood sugar levels Patients who are using an aerosol bronchodilator and an aerosol form of either ipratropium or a corticosteroidsuch as beclomethasone dipropionate BecloventVanceril should use the bronchodilator first then wait minutes before using the other medicine Check with aphysician before using any other inhaled medications or other asthma medicines The physician must determinethe proper amount of time between doses Some bronchodilator products contain sulfites that trigger an allergic reaction in

allows the visual examination of the lower airways Purpose During a bronchoscopy a physician can visually examine the lower airways including the larynx tracheabronchi and bronchioles The procedure is used to examine the mucosal surface of the airways for abnormalitiesthat might be associated with a variety of lung diseasesIts use includes the visualization of airway obstructionssuch as a tumor or the collection of specimens for thediagnosis of cancer originating in the bronchi of the lungs bronchogenic cancer It can also be used to collectspecimens for culture to diagnose infectious diseases suchas tuberculosis The type of specimens collected can include sputum composed of saliva and discharges fromthe respiratory passages tissue samples from the bronchior bronchioles or cells collected from washing the liningof the bronchi or bronchioles The instrument used inbronchoscopy a bronchoscope is a slender cylindricalinstrument containing a light and an eyepiece There aretwo types of bronchoscopes a rigid tube that is sometimes referred to as an opentube or ventilating bronchoscope and a more flexible fiberoptic tube This tube contains four smaller passagestwo for light to passthrough one for seeing through and one that can accommodate medical instruments that may be used for biopsyor suctioning or that medication can be passed through Bronchoscopy may be used for the following pur poses to diagnose cancer tuberculosis lung infection or other lung disease to examine an inherited deformity of the lungs to remove a foreign body in the lungs such as a mucus plug tumor or excessive secretions to remove tissue samples also known as biopsy to test for cancer cells help with staging the advancement ofthe lung cancer or to treat a tumor with laser therapy to allow examination of a suspected tumor obstruction secretion bleeding or foreign body in the airways to determine the cause of a persistent cough wheezing or a cough that includes blood in the sputum to evaluate the effectiveness of lung cancer treatments Precautions Patients not breathing adequately on their own due to severe respiratory failure may require mechanical ventilation prior to bronchoscopy It may not be appropriate to perform bronchoscopy on patients with anunstable heart condition All patients must be constantlymonitored while undergoing a bronchoscopy so that anyabnormal reactions can be dealt with immediately Description There are two types of bronchoscopes a rigid tube and a fiberoptic tube Because of its flexibility the fiberop GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bronchoscopy Instruments used in bronchoscopy procedures Custom Medical Stock Photo Reproduced by permissionGEM to B PM Page tic tube is usually preferred However if the purpose of the procedure is to remove a foreign body caught in the windpipe or lungs of a child the more rigid tube must be usedbecause of its larger size The patient will either lie faceupon hisher back or sit upright in a chair Medication todecrease secretions lessen anxiety and relax the patient are often given prior to the procedure While breathingthrough the nose anesthesia is sprayed into the mouth ornose to numb it It will take one to two minutes for theanesthesia to take effect Once this happens the bronchoscope will be put into the patients mouth or nose andmoved down into the throat While the bronchoscope ismoving down the throat additional anesthesia is put intothe bronchoscope to numb the lower parts of the airwaysUsing the eyepiece the physician then observes the trachea and bronchi and the mucosal lining of these passageways looking for any abnormalities that may be present If the purpose of the bronchoscopy is to take tissue samples or biopsy forceps or a bronchial brush are usedto obtain cells If the purpose is to identify an infectiousagent a bronchoalveolar lavage BAL can be used togather fluid for culture purposes Also if any foreignmatter is found in the airways it can be removed Another procedure using bronchoscopy is called flu orescence bronchoscopy This can be used to detect precancerous cells present in the airways By using a fluo rescent light in the bronchoscope precancerous tissuewill appear dark red while healthy tissue will appeargreen This technique can help detect lung cancer at anearly stage so that treatment can be started early Alternative procedures Depending upon the purpose of the bronchoscopy alternatives might include a computed tomography scanCT or no procedure at all Bronchoscopy is often performed to investigate an abnormality that shows up on achest x ray or CT scan If the purpose is to obtain biopsy specimens one option is to perform surgery which carriesgreater risks Another option is percutaneous through theskin biopsy guided by computed tomography Preparation The doctor should be informed of any allergies and all the medications that the patient is currently taking Thedoctor may instruct the patient not to take medicationslike aspirin or antiinflammatory drugs which interfere with clotting for a period of time prior to the procedureThe patient needs to fast for to hours prior to the procedure and refrain from drinking any liquids the day ofthe procedure The bronchoscopy takes about to minutes with results usually available in one day Prior tothe bronchoscopy several tests may be done including achest x ray and blood work Sometimes a bronchoscopy isdone under general anesthesia Patients usually have anintravenous IV line in the arm Most likely the procedure will be done under local anesthesia which is sprayedinto the nose or mouth This is necessary to decrease thegag reflex A sedative may also be used to help the patientrelax It is important that the patient understands that at notime will the airway be blocked and that oxygen can besupplied through the bronchoscope A signed consentform is necessary for this procedure Aftercare After the bronchoscopy the patient will be monitored for vital signs such as heart rate blood pressure andbreathing while resting in bed Sometimes patients havean abnormal reaction to anesthesia All saliva should bespit into a basin so that it can be examined for the presence of blood If a biopsy was taken the patient shouldnot cough or clear the throat as this might dislodge anyblood clot that has formed and cause bleeding No food ordrink should be consumed for about two hours after theprocedure or until the anesthesia wears off Diet is gradually progressed from ice chips and clear liquids to thepatients regular diet There will also be a temporary sore

airways This results insome swelling and inflammation as well as hoarsenesscaused from abrading the vocal cords If this abrasion ismore serious it can lead to respiratory difficulty or bleeding of the airway lining A more serious risk involved inhaving a bronchoscopy performed is the occurrence of apneumothorax due to puncturing of the lungs which allows air to escape into the space between the lung andthe chest wall These risks are greater with the use of arigid bronchoscope than with a fiberoptic bronchoscopeIf a rigid tube is used there is also a risk of chipped teeth Normal results Normal tracheal appearance consists of smooth muscle with Cshaped rings of cartilage at regular intervals The trachea and the bronchi are lined with a mucousmembrane Abnormal results Abnormal

the disease includeintermittent fever sweating chills aches and mental depression The disease can become chronic and recurparticularly if untreated Description Also known as undulant fever Malta fever Gibraltar fever Bangs disease or Mediterranean fever brucellosisis most likely to occur among those individuals who regularly work with livestock The disease originated indomestic livestock but was passed on to wild animalspecies including the elk and buffalo of the westernUnited States In humans brucellosis continues to bespread via unpasteurized milk obtained from infectedcows or through contact with the discharges of cattle andgoats during miscarriage In areas of the world where milk is not pasteurized for example in Latin Americaand the Mediterranean the disease is still contracted byingesting unpasteurized dairy products However in theUnited States the widespread pasteurization of milk andnearly complete eradication of the infection from cattlehas reduced the number of human cases from in to about in Causes and symptoms The disease is caused by several different species of parasitic bacteria of the genus Brucella B abortus is found in cattle and can cause cows to abort their fetuses GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BrucellosisGEM to B PM Page B suis is most often found in hogs and is more deadly when contracted by humans than the organism found incattle B melitensis is found in goats and sheep and caus es the most severe illness in humans B rangiferi infects reindeer and caribou and B canis is found in dogs A human contracts the disease by coming into con tact with an infected animal and either allowing the bacteria to enter a cut breathing in the bacteria or by consuming unpasteurized milk or fresh goat cheese obtainedfrom a contaminated animal In the United States thedisease is primarily confined to slaughterhouse workers Scientists do not agree about whether brucellosis can be transmitted from one person to another althoughsome people have been infected from a tainted bloodtransfusion or bone marrow transplant Newborn babies have also contracted the illness from their mothers during birth Currently it is believed that brucellosis canalso be transmitted sexually The disease is not usually fatal but the intermittent fevers a source of its nickname undulant fever can beexhausting Symptoms usually appear between five daysand a month after exposure and begin with a single boutof high fever accompanied by shivering aching anddrenching sweats that last for a few days Other symptoms may include headache poor appetite backache weakness and depression Mental depression can be sosevere that the patient may become suicidal In rare untreated cases the disease can become so severe that it leads to fatal complications such as pneu monia or bacterial meningitis B melitensis can cause miscarriages especially during the first three months ofpregnancy The condition can also occur in a chronic form in which symptoms recur over a period of monthsor yearsKEY TERMS Antibody A specific protein produced by the immune system in response to a specific foreignprotein or particle called an antigen Chronic Disease or condition characterized by slow onset over a long period of time Parasite An organism living in or on and obtain ing nourishment from another organism Pasteurization The process of applying heat usually to milk or cheese for the purpose ofkilling or retarding the development of pathogenic bacteriaDiagnosis Brucellosis is usually diagnosed by detecting one or more Brucella species in blood or urine samples The bacteria may be positively identified using biochemicalmethods or using a technique whereby if present in thesample the brucellosis bacteria are made to fluoresceBrucellosis may also be diagnosed by culturing and isolating the bacteria from one of the above samples Bloodsamples will also indicate elevated antibody levels orincreased amounts of a protein produced directly inresponse to infection with brucellosis bacteria Treatment Prolonged treatment with antibiotics including tetracyclines with streptomycin cotrimoxazole and sulfonamides is effective Bed rest is also imperative In the chronic form of brucellosis the symptoms may recurrequiring a second course of treatment Prognosis Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is essential to prevent chronic infection Untreated the disease may lingerfor years but it is rarely fatal Relapses may also occur Prevention There is no human vaccine for brucellosis but humans can be protected by controlling the disease inlivestock After checking to make sure an animal is notalready infected and destroying those that are all livestock should be immunized Butchers and those whowork in slaughterhouses should wear protective glassesand clothing and protect broken skin from infection Some experts suggest that a person with the disease refrain from engaging in unprotected sex until free of thedisease The sexual partners of an infected person

ten derness of the skin or mucous membranes due to theleakage of blood from an injured blood vessel into thetissues Pupura refers to bruising as the result of a diseasecondition A very small bruise is called a petechia Theseoften appear as many tiny red dots clustered togetherand could indicate a serious problem Description Bruises change colors over time in a predictable pat tern so that it is possible to estimate when an injuryoccurred by the color of the bruise Initially a bruise willbe reddish the color of the blood under the skin Afterone to two days the red blood cells begin to break downand the bruise will darken to a blue or purplish colorThis fades to green at about day six Around the eighth orninth day the skin over the bruised area will have abrown or yellowish appearance and it will graduallydiminish back to its normal color Long periods of standing will cause the blood that collects in a bruise to seep through the tissues Bruisesare actually made of little pools of blood so the blood inone place may flow downhill after awhile and appear inanother For instance bruising in the back of theabdomen may eventually appear in the groin bruising inthe thigh or the knee will work its way down to the ankle Causes and symptoms Healthy people may develop bruises from any injury that doesnt break through the skin Vigorous exercise may also cause bruises due to bringing about small tearsin blood vessels walls In a condition known as purpurasimplex there is a tendency to bruise easily due to anincreased fragility of the blood vessels Bruises alsodevelop easily in the elderly because the skin and bloodvessels have a tendency to become thinner and morefragile with aging and there is an increased use of med ications that interfere with the blood clotting system Inthe condition known as purpura senilis the elderly develop bruises from minimal contact that may take up to several months to completely heal The use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatories such as ibuprofen Advil and naproxen Aleve may lead toincreased bruising Aspirin antidepressants asthma medications and cortisone medications also have thiseffect The anticlotting medications also known as bloodthinners especially the drug Warfarin Coumadin maybe the cause of particularly severe bruising Sometimes bruises are connected with more serious illnesses There are a number of diseases that causeexcessive bleeding or bleeding from injuries too slight tohave consequences in healthy people An abnormal tendency to bleed may be due to hereditary bleeding disorders certain prescription

Battles signmay be due to a skull fracture and raised bruises maypoint to autoimmune disease Diagnosis Bruising is usually a minor problem which does not require a medical diagnosis However faced with extensive bruising bruising with no apparent cause or bruising in certain locations a physician will pursue an evaluation that will include a number of blood tests If the areaof the bruise becomes hard an x ray may be required Treatment A bruise by itself needs no medical treatment It is often recommended that ice packs be applied on and offduring the first hours of injury to reduce the bruisingAfter that heat especially moist heat is recommendedto increase the circulation and the healing of the injuredtissues Rest elevation of the effected part and compression with a bandage will also retard the accumulation ofblood Rarely if a bruise is so large that the body cannotcompletely absorb it or if the site becomes infected itmay have to be surgically removed Alternative treatment Several types of topical applications are usually rec ommend to speed healing and to reduce the pain associ ated with bruises Vitamin K cream can be applied directly to the site of injury Astringent herbs such as witchhazel Hamamelis virginiana can be used This will tighten the tissues and therefore diminish the bruisingThe homeopathic remedy Arnica montana can be applied as a cream or gel to unbroken skin Oral homeopathic remedies may reduce bruising pain and swelling as well Arnica montana at ml oz taken one to two times per day is highly recommended For ledum ml oz one to two times perday is also useful Prognosis The blood under the skin which causes the discol oration of bruising should be totally reabsorbed by thebody in three weeks or less At that time the skin colorshould completely return to normalSometimes a bruise may become solid and increase in size instead of dissolving This may indicate bloodtrapped in the tissues which may be need to be drainedThis is referred to as a hematoma Less commonly thebody may develop calcium deposits at the injury site in aprocess called heterotopic ossification Prevention Vitamin K promotes normal clotting in the blood and therefore may help reduce the tendency to bruiseeasily Green leafy vegetables alfalfa broccoli seaweedand fish liver oils are dietary sources of vitamin K Othergood foods to eat would be those containingbioflavonoids such as reddishblue berries These canassist in strengthening the connective tissue which willdecrease the spread of blood and bruising Zinc and vitamin C supplements are also

chewing surfaces of teeth flattened tooth surfacesloosened teeth and fractured teeth and fillings Left untreated bruxism may lead to tooth loss and jaw dysfunction Diagnosis Medical and dental histories and examinations are necessary to differentiate bruxism from other conditionsthat may cause similar pain such as ear infections dental infections and temporomandibular joint TMJ dysfunction However uncommonly worndown teeth stronglysuggest a diagnosis of bruxism Treatment To prevent further damage to the teeth bruxism is treated by placing a removable customfitted plasticappliance called

adjusted and high spots removed so that the teeth fit together in amore comfortable position Missing teeth may bereplaced and crooked teeth may be straightened withorthodontic treatment to eliminate possible underlyingcauses of bruxism In cases where jaw muscles are verytight a dentist may prescribe muscle relaxants Alternative treatment Stress management and behavior modification tech niques may be useful to break the habit of clenching andteeth grinding Tight jaw muscles may be relaxed byapplying warm compresses to the sides of the faceHerbal muscle relaxants also can be helpful Massage

clotting in the veins flowing out of the liver GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BuddChiari syndromeGEM to B PM Page hepatic veins The high pressure of blood in these veins leads to an enlarged liver and to an accumulation of fluidin the abdomen called ascites Description The liver the largest internal organ in the human body is responsible for many vital physiologic processes Blood flow through the liver nourishes the liver carries in substances that the liver will process and carriesaway substances that the liver has produced When bloodcannot flow out freely from the liver blood pressure risesin the veins of the liver leading to blood clots within theliver Also some of the blood plasma can leak throughthe walls of the veins and accumulate within theabdomen ascites Causes and symptoms The major symptoms include pain in the upper righthand portion of the abdomen and a buildup of fluidin the abdomen In the United States blood disorders arethe most common causes Among these disorders arepolycythemia rubra vera an increase in the number ofred blood cells and sickle cell disease In parts of the world where liver cancer is common a form of liver cancer is the most frequent cause Other causes sometimes include certain infections use of oral contraceptives body changes in pregnancy and the postpartum period phlebitis inflammation of a vein injury to the abdomen membranous webs especially in AsiaKEY TERMS Ascites Accumulation of fluid in the abdomen Biopsy Surgical removal of a tiny bit of tissue for examination under the microscope Catheter A tubular surgical instrument Phlebitis Inflammation of a vein Polycythemia rubra vera An excess number of red blood cells in the blood Sickle cell disease An inherited disease in which red blood cells take an unusual shape leading tocirculation problemsDiagnosis Diagnosis of BuddChiari syndrome can be made by an internist a specialist in diseases of the internalorgans a gastroenterologist a specialist in the diseasesof the digestive system or a general surgeon On physi cal examination the doctor will note that the liver is larger than normal Often an ultrasound scan of the liverwill show abnormalities in the size of the liver an abnormal pattern of the veins in the liver and other abnormalities A CT scan will often show similar abnormalities Once these abnormalities are confirmed the key test is called hepatic vein catheterization In this test a narrowtube is snaked through the body until it reaches the hepatic veins An instrument at the tip of the catheter can measure the pressure within each segment of the hepatic vein In some cases a tiny amount of radioactive material is injected into a patient and then an abnormal pattern ofradioactivity in the liver can be revealed In other cases aliver biopsy enables a physician to examine cells from the liver itself Cells damaged by BuddChiari syndrome have acharacteristic appearance easily identifiable to a physician Treatment Surgery Most patients with BuddChiari syndrome must have surgery A surgeon will reroute blood flow aroundthe clotted hepatic vein into a large vein called the venacava The exact technique will depend on the specificlocation of the clots and other factors In certain patientsother surgical techniques may be used For patients whootherwise would have less than six months to live liver transplantation is sometimes performed In a few patients a balloon catheter can open the blocked blood vessels without the need for major surgery Drugs Sometimes anticlotting drugs such as urokinase can be used for patients with a sudden onset of clotting inthe veins of the liver These drugs do not seem to workwhen the clots have become established Prognosis If surgery is done before permanent liver damage sets in longterm survival is possible In these cases damagedliver cells can actually recover If patients are already verysick with liver disease the surgery may not be as helpful Prevention The best approach to prevention is to

Definition Buergers disease is an inflammation of the arteries veins and nerves in the legs principally leading torestricted blood flow Left untreated Buergers diseasecan lead to gangrene of the affected areas Buergers dis ease is also known as thromboangitis obliterans Causes and symptoms The exact cause of Buergers disease is not known It is seen most often in young to middleaged men ages who are heavy smokers of cigarettes Cases ofthis disease in nonsmokers are very rare hence cigarette smoking is considered a causative factor Approxi mately of the patients have a history of inflammation of a vein phlebitis which may play a role in thedevelopment of Buergers disease The disease is mainlyseen in the legs of affected persons but may also appearin their arms Early symptoms include decrease in theblood supply arterial ischemia and superficial near the skin surface phlebitis The main symptom is pain in the affected areas Onset of the disease is gradual and firstoccurs in the feet or hands Inflammation occurs in smalland mediumsized arteries and veins near the surface ofthe limb In advanced cases blood vessels in other partsof the body may be affected There is a progressivedecrease in the blood flow to the affected areas Thepulse in arteries of the feet is weak or undetectable Thelack of blood flow can lead to gangrene which is decayof tissue due to restricted blood supply A cold sensitivityin the hands similar to that seen in Raynauds disease can develop In this case the hands turn colorwhiteblue and then redwhen exposed to the cold Diagnosis Diagnosis is usually made from the clinical symp toms Patients frequently complain of numbness tingling or burning sensations in the affected area beforeevidence of vascular inflammation becomes apparentKEY TERMS Gangrene A decay of the tissue in a part of the body that experiences restricted blood flow Inflammation A local reaction to irritation injury or infection characterized by pain swelling redness and occasional loss of function Ischemia A decrease in the blood supply to an area of the body caused by obstruction or constriction of blood vessels Phlebitis Inflammation of a vein Treatment There is no effective medication or surgery for this disease Patients must stop smoking to halt further development of the symptoms Vasodilators drugs that increase the diameter of the blood vessels can be administered but may not be effective Exposure of affectedareas to heat or cold should be avoided Trauma to thefeet and other affected areas should be avoided and infections must be treated promptly Prognosis The disease is progressive in patients who do not stop smoking Areas with gangrene must be removed surgically Prevention Smoking is the only known causative agent for this

amounts of food binge and then try to rid themselves of the food and calories purge by fasting exces sive exercise vomiting or using laxatives The behavior often serves to reduce stress and relieve anxiety Because bulimia results from an excessive concern with weightcontrol and selfimage and is often accompanied bydepression it is also considered a psychiatric illness Description Bulimia nervosa is a serious health problem for over two million adolescent girls and young women in theUnited States The bingeing and purging activity associated with this disorder can cause severe damage evendeath although the risk of death is not as high as for anorexia nervosa an eating disorder that leads to exces sive weight loss Binge eating may in rare instances cause the stom ach to rupture In the case of purging heart failure can result due to loss of vital minerals such as potassium V omiting causes other serious problems including acidrelated scarring of the fingers if used to induce vomiting and

Bulimic behavior is often carried out in secrecy accompanied by feelings of guilt or shame Outwardlymany people with bulimia appear healthy and successfulwhile inside they have feelings of helplessness and lowselfesteem Causes and symptoms Causes The cause of bulimia is unknown Researchers believe that it may be caused by a combination of geneticand environmental factors Bulimia tends to run in families Research shows that certain brain chemicals knownas neurotransmitters may function abnormally in acutelyill bulimia patients Scientists also believe there may be a link between bulimia and other psychiatric problemssuch as depression and OCD Environmental influencesinclude participation in work or sports that emphasizethinness such as modeling dancing or gymnastics Family pressures also may play a role One study found thatmothers who are extremely concerned about their daughters physical attractiveness and weight may help to causebulimia In addition girls with eating

intraventricular conduction defects IVCDThere are two bundle branches right and left The rightbundle carries nerve impulses that cause contraction of theright ventricle the lower chamber of the heart and the leftbundle carries nerve impulses that cause contraction of theleft ventricle The two bundles initially are together at ajunction called the bundle of His Nerve impulses comethrough the sinus node of the heart to the bundle of Hisand then move into the right and left bundle branchesBundle branch block is a slowing or interruption of nerveimpulses A problem may exist in any of the three bundles Patients with BBB are generally without symptoms unless the disease is severe enough to cause a completeinfranodal AV block and very slow heart rate In patientswith right bundle branch block RBBB the nerve impulseis conducted slowly or not at all The right ventricle finallyreceives the impulse through muscletomuscle spreadoutside the regular nerve pathway This mechanism ofimpulse transmission is slow and results in a delayed contraction of the right ventricle There are several types ofleft bundle branch block LBBB each producing its owncharacteristic mechanism of failure In each case thenerve impulse is blocked or delayed Patients with LBBBmay have left ventricular disease or cardiomyopathy Causes and symptoms Left bundle branch block usually happens as a con sequence of other diseases such as arteriosclerosisrheumatic fever congenital heart disease myocardi tis myocardial infarction metastatic heart tumors or other invasions of the heart tissue Right bundle

bunion is an abnormal enlargement of the joint the first metatarsophalangeal joint or MTPJ at the baseof the great or big toe hallux It is caused by inflammation and usually results from chronic irritation and pressure from poorly fitting footwear Description A displacement of two major bones of the foot hal lux valgus causes bunions although not everyone withthis displacement will develop the joint swelling andbone overgrowth that characterize a bunion One of thebones involved is called the first metatarsal bone Thisbone is long and slender with the big toe attached on one GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BunionGEM to B PM Page end and the other end connected to foot bones closer to the ankle This foot bone is displaced in the direction ofthe four other metatarsals connected with the toes Theother bone involved is the big toe itself which is displaced toward the smaller toes As the big toe continuesto move toward the smaller toes it may become displaced under or over the second toe The displacement ofthese two foot bones causes a projection of bone on theinside portion of the forefoot The skin over this projection often becomes inflamed from rubbing against theshoe and a callus may form The joint contains a small sac bursa filled with fluid that cushions the bones and helps the joint to movesmoothly When a bunion forms this sac becomesinflamed and thickened The swelling in the joint causesadditional pain and pressure in the toe Causes and symptoms Bunions may form as a result of abnormal motion of the foot during walking or running One common example of an abnormal movement is an excessive amount ofstress placed upon the inside of the foot This leads to friction and irritation of the involved structures Age hasalso been noted as a factor in developing bunions in partbecause the underlying bone displacement worsens overtime unless corrective measures are taken Wearing improperly fitting shoes especially those with a narrow toe box and excessive heel height oftencauses the formation of a bunion This forefoot deformityis seen more often in women than men The higher frequency in females may be related to the strong linkbetween footwear fashion and bunions In fact in arecent survey of more than women nearly woreshoes that were at least one size too small or too narrow Because genetic factors can predispose people to the hallux valgus bone displacement a strong family historyof bunions can increase the likelihood of developing thisfoot disorder Various arthritic conditions and severalgenetic and neuromuscular diseases such as Down syn drome and Marfan syndrome cause muscle imbal ances that can create bunions from displacement of thefirst metatarsal and big toe Other possible causes ofbunions are leglength discrepancies with the bunionpresent on the longer leg and trauma occurring to thejoint of the big toe Symptoms of bunions include the common signs of inflammation such as redness swelling and pain Thediscomfort is primarily located along the inside of thefoot just behind the big toe Because of friction a callusmay develop over the bunion If an overlapping of thetoes is allowed additional rubbing and pain occursInflammation of this area causes a decrease in motion with associated discomfort in the joint between the bigtoe and the first metatarsal If allowed to worsen the skinover the bunion may break down causing an ulcer whichalso presents a problem of potential infection Footulcers can be particularly dangerous for people with diabetes who may have trouble feeling the ulcer formingand healing if it becomes infected Diagnosis A thorough medical history and physical exam by a physician is always necessary for the proper diagnosis ofbunions and other foot conditions X rays can help confirm the diagnosis by showing the bone displacementjoint swelling and in some cases the overgrowth ofbone that characterizes bunions Doctors will also consider the possibility that the joint pain is caused by orcomplicated by arthritis which causes destruction of thecartilage of the joint gout which causes the accumula tion of uric acid crystals in the joint tiny fractures of a bone in the foot stress fractures or infection and mayorder additional tests to rule out these possibilities Treatment Conservative The first step in treating a bunion is to remove as much pressure from the area as possible People withbunions should wear shoes that have enough room in thetoe box to accommodate the bunion and avoid highheeledshoes and tightfitting socks or stockings Dressings andpads help protect the bunion from additional shoe pressure The application of splints or customized shoe insertsorthotics to correct the alignment of the big toe joint iseffective for many bunions Most patients are instructed to GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE Bunion Womans right foot with bunion on big toe Photograph by Wedgworth Custom Medical Stock Photo Reproduced by permissionGEM to B PM Page rest or choose exercises that put less stress on their feet at least until the misalignment is corrected In some casesphysicians also use steroid injections with local anestheticaround the bunion to reduce inflammation Surgery If conservative treatment is not successful surgical removal of the bunion may be necessary to correct thedeformity This procedure is called a bunionectomy andthere are many variations on the operation which is usually performed by a surgeon who specializes in treatingbone conditions orthopedics or by one who specializesin treating the foot podiatry Surgeons consider theangle of the bone misalignment the condition of thebursa and the strength of the bones when they choosewhich procedure to use Most bunionectomies involvethe removal of a section of bone and the

procedure the bones andother tissues are held in place while they heal by compression dressings or a short cast The individual mustrefrain from vigorous exercise for six weeks Alternative treatment Deep friction massage techniques by a physical or massage therapist can be helpful to increase circulationreduce inflammation and prevent soft tissue build upPhysical therapy also provides useful

firstdegree burn causes GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BurnsGEM to B PM Page redness and swelling in the outermost layers of skin epi dermis A seconddegree burn involves redness swellingand blistering and the damage may extend beneath theepidermis to deeper layers of skin dermis A thirddegree burn also called a fullthickness burn destroys theentire depth of skin causing significant scarring Damagealso may extend to the underlying fat muscle or bone The severity of the burn is also judged by the amount of body surface area BSA involved Health careworkers use the rule of nines to determine

reliefwhen applied to small areas of first and seconddegreeburns Butter shortening or similar salve should never beapplied to the burn since it prevents heat from escapingand drives the burning process deeper into the skin If the burn is minor it may be cleaned gently with soap and water Blisters should not be broken If the skinof the burned area is unbroken and it is not likely to befurther irritated by pressure or friction the burn shouldbe left exposed to the air to promote healing If the skinis broken or apt to be disturbed the burned area shouldbe coated lightly with an antibacterial

aspirating some of the synovial fluid forexamination can confirm the diagnosis In most casesthe fluid will not be clear It can be tested for the presence of microorganisms which would indicate an infection and crystals which could indicate gout In instanceswhere the diagnosis is difficult a local anesthetic a drugthat numbs the area is injected into the painful spot Ifthe discomfort stops temporarily then bursitis is probably the correct diagnosis Treatment Conservative treatment of bursitis is usually effec tive The application of heat rest and immobilization of GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE BursitisGEM to B PM Page the affected joint area is the first step A sling can be used for a shoulder injury a cane is helpful for hip problemsThe patient can take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs like aspirin ibuprofin and naproxen They can be obtained without a prescription and relievethe pain and inflammation Once the pain decreasesexercises of the affected area can begin If the nearbymuscles have become weak because of the disease orprolonged immobility then exercises to build strengthand improve movement are best A doctor or physicaltherapist can prescribe an effective regimen If the bursitis is related to an inflammatory condition like arthritis or gout then management of that disease isneeded to control the bursitis When bursitis does not respond to conservative treatment an injection into the joint of a longacting corticosteroid preparation like prednisone can bring immediate and lasting relief A corticosteroid is a hormonalsubstance that is the most effective drug for reducinginflammation The drug is mixed with a local anestheticand works on the joint within five minutes Usually oneinjection is all that is needed Surgery to remove the damaged bursa may be per formed in extreme cases If the bursitis is caused by an infection then addi tional treatment is needed Septic bursitis is caused by the presence of a pusforming organism usually staphylococ cus aureus This is confirmed by examining a sample of the fluid in the bursa and requires treatment with antibi otics taken by mouth injected into a muscle or into a vein intravenously The bursa will also need to be drained byneedle two or three times over the first week of treatmentWhen a patient has such a serious infection there may beunderlying causes There could be undiscovered diabetesor an inefficient immune system caused by humanimmunodeficiency virus infection HIV Alternative treatment Alternative treatments take into consideration the role of diet in causing bursitis The faulty use of calciumby the body magnesium deficiency and food allergies may have a role Diet changes and vitamin supplementsmay be helpful The use of herbs homeopathy aro matherapy and hydrotherapy can help relieve symp toms Ginger is useful in reducing inflammationAcupuncture has been proven effective in treating hip and shoulder pain caused by bursitis and other conditions Other therapies that deal effectively with musculoskeletal problems relating to the muscles and skeleton may also be helpful such as body work magnetic field therapy naturopathic medicine

Bursitis usually responds well to treatment but it may develop into a chronic condition if the underlyingcause is not corrected Prevention Aggravating factors should be eliminated to prevent bursitis Overexercising or the repetition of a movementthat triggers the condition should be avoided Doing exercises to strengthen the muscles around the joint will alsohelp When doing repetitive tasks

asthmalike narrowing of the airways Also called brown lung disease byssinosis resultsfrom inhaling particles of cotton flax hemp or jute Description Although inhaling cotton dust was identified as a source of respiratory disease more than years agobyssinosis has been recognized as an occupational hazard for textile workers for less than years More than workers in the cotton flax and ropemakingindustries are exposed in the workplace to airborne particles that can cause byssinosis Only workers in mills thatmanufacture yarn thread or fabric have a significant riskof dying of this disease In the United States byssinosis is almost completely limited to workers who handle unprocessed cotton Morethan textile workers have been disabled by byssinosis and died between and Most of thepeople whose deaths were due to byssinosis lived in thetextileproducing regions of North and South Carolina Causes and symptoms Wheezing shortness of breath and a feeling of tightness in the chest occur occasionally during the earlystages of the disease Symptoms are usually more pronounced when returning to work after a weekend holiday or vacation and subside as the worker becomes reaccustomed to the environment As many as of workers with byssinosis have symptoms that continue or recur throughout the workweek More severe breathing problems seem to resultboth from exposure to high levels of dust and fromlonger dust exposure Workers who also smoke cigarettessuffer the most severe impairmentDiagnosis Tests that detect decreasing lung capacity during the workday are used to diagnose byssinosis Obstructivepatterns are likely in patients who have had recurrentsymptoms for more than years Treatment Therapy for earlystage byssinosis focuses on reversing airway narrowing Antihistamines may be pre scribed to reduce tightness in the chest Bronchodilators drugs used to relax breathing passages and improve airflow may be used with an inhaler or taken in tablet formReducing exposure is essential Any worker who hassymptoms of byssinosis or who has trouble breathingshould transfer to a lesscontaminated area Prognosis Smoking impaired lung function and a history of respiratory allergy increase a textile workers risk of developing byssinosis Prolonged exposure makes patientswheeze more often and can cause chronic bronchitis It does not lead to permanently disabling lung disease Prevention Eliminating exposure to textile dust is the surest way to prevent byssinosis Using exhaust hoods improvingventilation and employing wetting procedures are verysuccessful methods of controlling dust levels to preventbyssinosis Protective equipment required during certainprocedures also prevents exposure to levels of contamination that exceed the current

converted into active forms Vitamin D level corresponds with the exogenous dietary intake of Vitamin D rich foods as well as supplements Vitamin D level corresponds with endogenous production as well as exogenous diet and supplements Vitamin D from sunshine on the skin or from dietary intake is converted predominantly by the liver into hydroxy vitamin D which has a long halflife and is stored in the adipose tissue The metabolically active form of vitamin D dihydroxy vitamin D which has a short life is then synthesized in the kidney as needed from circulating hydroxy vitamin D The reference

to Severe Decrease Severe Decrease Clinical Significance The normal serum creatinine reference interval does not necessarily reflect a normal GFR for a patient Because mild and moderate kidney injury is poorly inferred from serum creatinine alone Thus it is recommended for clinical laboratories to routinely estimate glomerular filtration rate eGFR a gold standard measurement for assessment of renal function and report the value when serum creatinine is measured for patients and older when appropriate and feasible It cannot be measured easily in clinical practice instead GFR is estimated from equations using serum creatinine age race and sex This provides easy to interpret information for the doctor and patient on the degree of renal impairment since it approximately equates to the percentage of kidney function remaining Application of CKDEPI equation together with the other diagnostic tools in renal medicine will further improve the detection and management of patients with CKD

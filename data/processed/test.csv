mildly improved after eating a candy bar The EMS was called and found his blood sugar at the time to be and noted to be in the Emergency Department He denied any seizure activity loss of consciousness incontinence shortness of breath fevers or chills chest pain change in urinary or bowel habits or suicidal ideation He has been depressed recently regarding stress with his home life and on the night of his extra insulin doses his wife had just kicked him out of the house He has had four past hospitalizations for attempted suicide with insulin overdosing usually denied The wife also states that he drinks more than he states In the Emergency Department he received amps of D and then D normal saline and D normal saline with blood sugars that were slow to increase leading the ICU team to suspect that the patient had taken more insulin than he admitted He also had a very positive tox screen for alcohol His fingersticks are currently in the s and his normal blood glucose at home ranges between per the patient The patient also now complains of increased right upper quadrant right rib cage pain and new headache He also complains of chronic photophobia which is unchanged He denied visual changes lightheadedness of dizziness currently neck stiffness or pain in any other area PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Insulindependent diabetes followed by Johannes Brink Depression Asthma Alcohol abuse

negative for benzos barbiturates opiates cocaine amphetamines and methadone Telemetry was notable for episodes of sinus tachycardia to s to s only HOSPITAL COURSE HYPOGLYCEMIA The patient had been initially very hypoglycemic on admission secondary to overdosing on insulin however with glucose repletion both in the Emergency Department and in the ICU this resolved and the patient also began to eat We checked fingerstick glucoses qid and at am His glucose on the morning of discharge was about so we opted to decrease his pm NPH dose slightly for discharge and continue covering him with sliding scale insulin He should also continue having a snack at midnight if able It is likely that he required a much greater amount of insulin as an outpatient due to poor compliance with Richard Natalie diet ALCOHOL ABUSE It is likely that the patient continues to drink more than he admits He did have past alcoholism consisting of a half a pint of brandy per day for three years but supposedly had quit in He had been on a diazepam CIWA scale prophylaxis against DT s however he had a very low CIWA scale during his entire admission and did not need any benzodiazepines This alcohol abuse may be further addressed as an inpatient on the Psychiatry Quincy Medical Center We had also requested a Social Work consult regarding this DEPRESSION vs Borderline personality disorder The patient has had several admissions in the past for attempted suicide with overdose of his insulin and though he denied at this time attempting to end his life it appears that the social situation of increased stressors corresponding to this time suggest that this is not the truth He received a onetoone sitter during his admission and will be transferred to the Psychiatry HealthSouth New England Rehab Hospital to ensure the patient s safety and initiate further antidepressant treatment He will need close followup regarding his depression as an outpatient although apparently this has been set up for him in the past and he had not followed through HISTORY OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE His blood pressure was fairly low with a maximum of s systolic during his admission thus we did not continue his lisinopril which he had been on in the past RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT PAIN We obtained a right upper quadrant ultrasound as well as LFTs amylase and lipase which were all normal He had no evidence of cholecystitis or gallstones or any abnormalities with the liver or kidneys it is possible that he has had a muscle strain or other musculoskeletal cause PROPHYLAXIS He was put on Pepcid for GI prophylaxis FLUIDS ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION He complied with Linda Chad diet while hospitalized The patient was hyperphosphatemic secondary to overadministration of NeutraPhos during his ICU stay He was given two doses of calcium carbonate gram and will most likely normalize secondary to both calcium binding and urinary excretion He has been asymptomatic DISCHARGE CONDITION Stable DISCHARGE

respiratory rate was on face mask Interoperatively he was positive two liters with a stable blood pressure and heart rate although requiring some neosynephrine interoperatively He responded to intravenous Lasix with liters of urine output as well as marked clinical improvement The etiology for his congestive heart failure was determined likely to be diastolic dysfunction from increased heart rate as well as excess volume No definite evidence for significant myocardial ischemia although cardiac enzymes were sent and he ruled out for myocardial infarction He was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit where his respiratory and cardiac status was monitored carefully He was given Lasix to continue to diurese the excess volume He was also put on Lopressor mg twice a day Also in the Intensive Care Unit O saturation was closely monitored The patient became agitated with both tent and BiPAP machine although continued to saturate well He was transferred to Medicine the morning of for continued medical management post surgery On the day of transfer the patient was noted to be confused with waxing and waning sensorium thus a delirium workup was initiated looking for precipitants When his O saturation was monitored his pulse oximetry remained in the s during his stay His nonessential medications that may have been contributing to his change in mental status were discontinued those included Temocillin Nortriptyline Haldol Lorazepam Venlafaxine Bupropion and Gabapentin In addition his cyclosporin levels were checked Hypo or hyperglycemia Mahoney had been following with their appreciated recommendations on glucose control Finger sticks were in the s when acutely agitated therefore it was not determined that glucose levels were contributory Infectious causes were evaluated He was febrile in the Intensive Care Unit to F yet chest xray blood cultures urinalysis and urine cultures were all negative for sources A lumbar puncture was considered although not performed due to the fact that the cerebrospinal fluid was not breached during the procedure Mass effect was considered although no focal deficits were ever noted on examination and due to the fluctuating sensorium it was determined that there was no severe underlying structural abnormality A head and neck CT scan noncontrast were ordered though to evaluate for such processes No acute intracranial hemorrhages or midline shifts were noted although a soft tissue mass was noted at the level of C This was determined to be within the normal expected changes post surgery Trauma was also considered The patient was found out of bed but no signs of head trauma no loss of consciousness Throughout his stay Chem was monitored There were no electrolytes or mineral abnormalities that could explain his delirium Liver function tests were checked only total bilirubin was slightly elevated at TSH was within normal limits as was B and folate RPR evaluating for possible neurologic syphilis was also checked The assay was nonreactive An EEG was also considered to rule out nonconvulsive status epilepticus although again this did not seem to be a likely cause On the evening of the nd the patient became acutely agitated threatening to leave and also threatening to harm those nurses and physicians that were attempting to prevent him from leaving Security was notified who then arrived to the room and helped to place the patient in fourpoint restraints for the safety of both the patient and the staff of the hospital The restraints were weaned off overnight although he became acutely agitated and they were replaced early on Later in the morning on the patient was more oriented and alert and asked to have the restraints removed They were taken off two at a time The patient continued to do well and did not require restraints after that event Intramuscular as well as intravenous Haldol were ordered prn for emergency use should he become acutely agitated haldol as well as the restraints were not required after the morning of the rd Each progressive day Mr Donald delirium abated with return to baseline mental status early on The likely cause of the delirium was a combination of surgery and Intensive Care Unit stay in addition to polypharmacy Other concerns during his stay was his kidney function due to his renal transplant in His immunosuppressive therapy was continued throughout his stay his creatinine remained approximately to he has a baseline renal insufficiency With this in mind when obtaining a CT scan it was determined that contrast would not be the best option While the patient was in restraints gentle hydration was initiated since po intake was not adequate As for his diabetes mellitus the Mahoney Team provided updated recommendations each day adjusting for the changing po intake The only other complaints from Mr Mackey during his stay were Soreness at his operative sites for which he was given prn Tylenol once his delirium had resolved In addition he also complained of difficulty with swallowing necessitating only soft and liquid diet This was attributed to postoperative swelling and changes from his diskectomy performed DISPOSITION

holding area and taken electively to the operating room She underwent a livingrelated renal transplant in the right iliac fossa The operation was somewhat technically difficult secondary to a short segment of ureter which was anastomosed over a stent to the bladder Otherwise there were difficulties and estimated blood loss was minimal She was taken postoperatively to the recovery room already making a large amount of urine Intraoperatively for immunosuppression she received thymoglobulin and SoluMedrol She was started on Prograf and CellCept in the postoperative period She was also maintained on Bactrim postoperatively and did not require ganciclovir as she and her sister were cytomegalovirus negative The patient s initial postoperative course was relatively uneventful Her creatinine which was initially postoperatively slowly dropped over the next few days until eventually reaching a low of She did receive pamidronate on postoperative day one and received a total of four doses thymoglobulin Her steroid doses were slowly tapered over her hospital course and her Prograf level was adjusted to maintain therapeutic values between and She continued to make good urine over the first few days and had her urine losses replaced with intravenous fluids On postoperative day three the patient had an episode of shortness of breath that was evaluated by both the Renal and surgical residents It was found that she was in acute pulmonary edema and required transfer to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit Her blood pressure at the time of this incident was in the range of Her electrocardiogram showed no specific ST changes but there was some loss of her R wave progression laterally Serial enzymes were drawn and Cardiology was consulted With blood pressure control via a nitroglycerin drip and fluid restriction the patient quickly improved and a had a relatively short stay in the Intensive Care Unit Throughout this time her creatinine continued to drop and there was no apparent deleterious effect on her transplant from this episode Her beta blocker was progressively increased and her nitroglycerin drip was weaned down Two days after this event she underwent an echocardiogram which was significant for slightly depressed left ventricular systolic function with severe posterior wall hypokinesis This was a change from her prior echocardiogram and demonstrated evidence of a small myocardial infarction Clinically she did much better and her blood pressure was optimized prior to discharge She was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day

unrestrained driver and struck a telephone pole He was ejected from the car and landed on his face Extreme damage was reported to the vehicle by first responders It was presumed highspeed motor vehicle collision The patient was CMEDflighted to Quincy Medical Center and he was intubated upon arrival in the Emergency Department After initial trauma assessment and initiation of resuscitation a CT scan was performed Images of his head abdomen and thorax were obtained His injuries included bilateral zygomal and orbital rim fractures a right temporal fracture bilateral frontal contusions and a right temporal epidural versus subdural hematoma The anterior and posterior of the frontal sinus was fractured with communication with the ethmoid air cells presumably caused air in the orbit PAST MEDICAL HISTORY Denies PAST SURGICAL HISTORY Denies SOCIAL HISTORY Denies ALLERGIES Denies MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION Denies PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION Initial examination revealed the patient had a heart rate in the s with a blood pressure of s He was intubated with multiple abrasions and severe swelling and contusions of his face He was not following commands His Boston Coma Scale was His pupils were reactive on the right going from mm to mm of light The response was brisk On the left his pupils went from mm to mm also brisk Initial evaluation revealed corticate posturing was noted by the trauma team He withdrew equally and purposefully after minutes in the trauma bay He withdrew to noxious stimuli equally and purposefully after minutes in the trauma bay HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM NEUROLOGY Mr Roach was transported to Intensive Care Unit from the trauma bay Upon arrival Neurosurgery promptly placed V Holtzen bolt This allowed continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure Notably intracranial pressure was when the bolt was placed During his hospitalization his intracranial pressure was monitored very closely and maintained to a level of less than To do this mannitol mg q h was used While using mannitol his serum osmolalities were followed closely In addition to monitoring his intracranial pressure his systemic blood pressures were maintained in such a manner that his cerebral perfusion pressure was maintained at mmHg A parameter monitor for his neurologic status PaCO which was maintained between and during his hospitalization Mr Roach was kept sedated with propofol and was given Fentanyl and or morphine boluses for pain Neurologic checks were followed initially every one hour and then every two hours to monitor for change in neurologic examination During his hospitalization two subsequent CAT scans were obtained one on hospital day two This CAT scan revealed possible worsening and was read as epidural versus subdural bleed After a discussion with both Radiology and Neurosurgery the decision was made that the worsening did not appear significant and this was not accompanied by a change in his clinical condition His intracranial pressure remained stable and his clinical examination was unchanged An additional CT scan was obtained on hospital day three This examination was unchanged from the previous examination Again his intracranial pressure and neurologic examination remained the same and conservative treatment was opted for CARDIOVASCULAR As described in previous section NeoSynephrine and eventually Levophed were used to maintain a coronary perfusion pressure of greater than A pulmonary artery catheter was placed on hospital day four This catheter was placed when the patient started to demonstrate septic physiology and for increasing pressor support Please see Infectious Disease section for more details GASTROINTESTINAL Mr Roach was npo from the time of his admission A orogastric tube was passed Initially during admission carafate was given down the orogastric tube However on a routine chest xray shot on hospital day three a mediastinum was noted This raised the question of potential esophageal rupture Gastroenterology was consulted for this Gastroenterology was consulted to assist in creating the most appropriate diagnostic rhythm given his intubated and sedated status At this point his carafate was switched to intravenous Protonix and he was strictly npo HEMATOLOGY Throughout Mr Richard admission his hematocrit remained stable in the low s As will be discussed in the Infectious Disease section he developed an episode of what appeared to be sepsis and his white blood cell count peaked at Mr Roach was on Pneumo boots spontaneous compression devices for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis He was not a candidate for subcutaneous heparin as we were concerned of an intracranial hemorrhage An inferior vena cava filter was considered but was deferred as it was felt that Mr Roach was too unstable to undergo the procedure ENDOCRINE Mr Marian blood sugar was maintained under tight control from to using a regular insulin slidingscale INFECTIOUS DISEASE Mr Roach had a spike in white blood cell count and developed fevers His blood urine and sputum were all cultured Blood cultures were pertinent for one bottle of gram positive coagulase negative Staphylococcus which grew from His preliminary cultures including sputum from grew Escherichia coli Sputum from grew gramnegative rods not yet speciated and from a bronchoalveolar lavage grew gramnegative rods and polymorphonuclear lymphocytes Throughout this time Mr Richard temperature continued to increase and was such that on hospital day four his temperature maximum was degrees centigrade During his hospitalization his was treated with vancomycin for his gramnegative rods imipenem and Flagyl Initially he had been placed on clindamycin to cover his drain but his cultures became positive and his white blood cell count increased He was switched from clindamycin to the imipenem and Flagyl Vancomycin was added when we had the positive blood culture With a fever of up to degrees centigrade aggressive measures including cooling blankets alcohol swabs and fans were used in an attempt to bring his body temperature down Hypercarbia would result and increase in cerebral perfusion paralysis was initiated to decrease genesis of carbon dioxide secreted during shivering PULMONARY As discussed in the Infectious Disease section Mr Roach developed a pneumonia likely from gramnegative organisms but most likely from Escherichia coli For this pneumonia he was placed empirically on imipenem vancomycin and Flagyl On hospital day three Mr Roach had developed an episode of tachycardia and tachypnea For this a CT angiogram was obtained which demonstrated no pulmonary embolism On hospital day four a routine chest xray revealed a leftsided pneumothorax For this a left Caucasian chest tube was placed On the evening of hospital day four Mr Roach had an acute episode whereby his central venous pressure rose sharply and immediately followed by a period of asystole Urgent resuscitation measures were initiated The measures included attempts at pacing Epinephrine and atropine were administered as were bicarbonate and calcium He had a differential diagnosis of asystole preceded by an acute rise in central venous pressure included attention pneumothorax cardiac tamponade and pulmonary embolism During the resuscitation afterwards it was noted that a patent left chest tube was present in the left chest so initially neodecompression was attempted in the right chest There was no sign of attention pneumothorax with decompression and a right chest tube was placed During this time a needle aspiration of what was felt to be the pericardium was performed revealing bloody fluid coming back A left anterior thoracotomy was made by the Cardiac Surgery fellow who was present After minutes of active resuscitation including internal cardiac massage there was no evidence of return of vital signs or electric activity to the heart as noted on electrocardiogram monitors Resuscitation was

admitted to the FICU On arrival to unit pt had EGD which revealed grade III esophageal varices with signs of old bleeding She was started on octreotide and nadolol to control portal htn Pt was stable and had appropriate Hct bump to after U PRBC s She also had climbing bilirubin and low grade temp and was started on Zosyn for suspected biliary obstruction and ascending cholangitis coverage She was rescoped on and varices were sclerosed no banding due to latex allergy and diuretics of lasix and aldactone were readded for ascites since BP stable she was transfused another U PRBC s with hct bump to and antibiotic coverage broadend to Unasyn Ceftriaxone Flagyl because she continued to spike and for SBP prophylaxis Preprocedure of PTC on she was transfused unit PRBC s platelets and U FFP and procedure went without complication ON transfer to the floor she remained hemodynamically stable with stable Hct and declining bilirubin She remained afebrile so on antibiotic regimen was weaned to only levofloxacin Liver teams recommended to repeat EGD with non latex banding in days She also went home on naldolol mg qd for portal htn and her home doses of diuretics to control her ascites US finding Pt was incidentally found to have R hydronephrosis and a R adenexal mass on her US The hydronephrosis was likely caused by blockage by her tumor Given her disease prognosis and the fact that her other kidney is functioning well no intervention was done Also the adenexal mass may represent a second primary maligancy This was seen on a prior CT scan and her oncologist is aware Again given

recently admitted to McLean Hospital from through with a diagnosis of right heel diabetic ulcer with MSSA osteomyelitis of the calcaneus MSSA bacteremia acute interstitial nephritis secondary to oxacillin and RLL pna He was sent home with a PICC line and IV antibiotics He returned to the Wing Memorial Medical Center intubated from an outside hospital on for respiratory failure and was sent to CMED CSRU Prior to his readmission his sister had noted that he was having some shaking chills and heavy breathing When he came back to Faulkner Hospital Hospital for confusion and diaphoresis his initial oxygen sat was only with a fingerstick of He was given D but continued to have progressive respiratory failure was therefore intubated and transferred to the Austen Riggs Center where he was noted to have multifocal pneumonia and bacteremia with enterobacter and MSSA Past Medical History diabetes type since age after pancreatic trauma diabetic retinopathy direct neuropathy PVD status post multiple toe amputations recent right heel osteomyelitis recent MSSA bacteremia multifocal pneumonia acute interstitial nephritis cataract surgery Social History divorced truck driver tobacco pack

pull out NG tube Pertinent Results CT chest IMPRESSION Extensive bilateral diffuse ground glass and more confluent areas of consolidation in both lungs consistent with the recent chest xray This non specific pattern could represent diffuse pneumonia complicated by ARDS This would likely less represent asymmetric pulmonary edema Small bilateral pleural effusions Echo Conclusions No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage No atrial septal defect is seen by D or color Doppler Left ventricular wall thickness cavity size and systolic function are normal LVEF Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal The ascending transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve Trace aortic regurgitation is seen The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve No vegetation mass is seen on the pulmonic valve There is a trivial physiologic pericardial effusion Head CT FINDINGS No intracranial hemorrhage is identified There is no mass effect or shift of the normally midline structures No major vascular territorial infarction is identified The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and symmetrical No osseous lesions are seen IMPRESSION No intracranial hemorrhage or CT evidence of acute infarction EEG IMPRESSION This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a low voltage and slow background consistent with a severe encephalopathy of toxic metabolic or anoxic etiology Note that with the documented movements of the patient s head and mouth no change on the EEG was seen No evidence of ongoing seizures was seen Cultures Urine and and yeast Sputum ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE IV catheter tip STAPHYLOCOCCUS COAGULASE NEGATIVE sensitive to vanc Blood ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE ENTEROCOCCUS FAECIUM STAPHYLOCOCCUS COAGULASE NEGATIVE ISOLATED FROM ONE SET ONLY Stool c diff negative Brief Hospital Course Respiratory failure On admission this was felt to be likely worsening PNA Pt remained intubated until He had difficulty weaning from the vent due to difficulties with neurological status he remained drowsy and unresponsive for many days but eventually awoke enough and was extubated without difficulty and remained stable on L NC He was transferred to the floor but a few days later began to show signs of respiratory distress and was transferred back to the CMED CSRU for reintubation for likely aspiration event leading to worsening pneumonia as well as some component of pulm edema He was extubated a few days later and transferred back to the floor where his pulm status improved dramatically with lasix and continued nebulizer treatments The patient was prepared for discharge on when he was sat ing in the high s on room air However on at am the pt was found with labored respirations rr and SaO which improved to only SaO on NRB ABG was performed mg lasix was given and the patietn had foley placed and had good urine output and good mentation He was also given nebulizers without improvement His chest radiograph had fluffy bilateral infiltrates Although the pt was wo fever he had chills He was readmitted tot he CMED CSRU for respiratory distress likely secondary to a recurrent aspiration event He was continued on meropenem started on BiPAP and aggressively suctioned in an attempt to avoid intubation On at am the patient had an acutechange in mental status with bradycardia hypertension pinpoint pupils decerebrate posturing and increased tone in bilateral upper extremities and unresponsiveness The patient was brought to CT immediately for stat scan and was found to have a massive occipital spontaneous hemorrhage into the L ventricle requiring ventricular drainage Neurosurgery was immediately called for an EVD and anesthesia was called STAT to the bedside for intubation at am in order to assist in hyperventilation After endotracheal intubation MAPs were maintained between and dilantin was dose to maintain an appropriate level L frontal ICP bolt was placed by neurosurgery under sterile conditions on antibiotics Mannitol mg iv x then gm iv tid was begun to maintain serum osm and Na The patient was hyperventilated to goal PCO with ICP improvement Serial head CT studies and neurologic exams were performed but the patient was unchaged unresponsive with posturing and no spontaneous movement despite ICP being maintained in good range On a family meeting resulted in the patient s code being changed to comfort measures only The patient was terminally extubated on a morphine drip and ativan titrated for agonal breathing and discomfort scopolamine was used as an adjunct to control secretions and appeared comfortable when he died at pm on The family refused autopsy or postmortem examination to deduce secondary causes of death ID Bacteremia and PNA Pt s triple lumen catheter was found to be growing coag neg staph and PICC tip and sputum growing enterobacter cloacae The PICC was dc ed and pt was continued on vancomycin for course of weeks and meropenem was added on for week course TEE was negative Pt finished the week course of meropenem while in house and was discharged to rehab on day of the vancomycin AIN Pt received oxacillin during his prior hospitalization and had AIN from this medication On this admission he was continued on prednisone taper Fluoroquinolones and other renal toxins were avoided Renal function gradually improved and Cr trended down from peak of to Before the patient acutely decompensated as above the plan was for steroid taper mg x days already completed mg x d already completed mg x d now day mg x d mg x d Foot ulcer The pt was followed by podiatry and had several further debridement of his R heel wound on abx podiatry following changed vac q days Encephalopathy It was unclear why the pt s mental status initially did not improve more quickly after all sedatives were removed and he was extubated His MS waxed and waned for many days and uremia vs failure to clear sedatives were considered although pt was making urine and LFT s are wnl The pt had an EEG and head CT s which did not show anoxic brain injury or bleeding He gradually improved and was AOx and near baseline before Amesbury Hospital transferred to the CMED CSRU in respiratory distress DM Pt was maintained on SSI with small amount of standing insulin while he was NPO and then his dose was gradually increased as he received tube feeds FEN The pt had an NG tube placed and received tube feeds for the majority of his hospitalization Upon extubation and transfer to the floor he pulled out the NG tube time several times and required restraints Albumin was very low and pt had significant edema likely this A few days before decompensating his mental status improved to the degree that he was able to eat normal food without aspirating CV Pump HTN pt had episodes of both hypertension and hypotension during his stay He was managed with Metoprolol Hydralazine and Amlodipine Near discharge his BP was controlled with Metoprolol only Hypernatremia While in the CMED CSRU the pt developed hypernatremia This was felt to be likely intravascular volume depletion since the pt s albumin was so low and he was third spacing all of his fluid He was volume resuscitated and managed with DW and lasix as well as receving FW boluses with his NG tube feeds The hypernatremia fully resolved when he resumed eating on his own and had access to free water Anemia Pt s Hct trended down slowly throughout his hospitalization Labs were consistent with anemia of chronic disease He was transfused units pRBC s near the end of his hospitalization and had an appropriate bump CMED CCU When the pt s MS improved to near baseline before again decompensating he became extremely tearful and expressed feelings of depression after being in the hospital for so long He expressed interest in taking an antidepressant for a short time while he was recovering and was
